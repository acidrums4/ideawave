IdeaWave is the first &ldquo;ideas conference&rdquo; to be held on Vancouver Island. On July 10 and 11, 2010 hundreds of critical thinkers, from inventors to philanthropists, will come together to share ideas and engage each other in dialogue about ideas and their place in the world.

IdeaWave is a forum where critical thinkers are able to mix and mingle in a highly engaged environment.

Each day consists of a series of 25 talks, each 10 minutes in length. Talks are designed to be a snapshot of the idea and to open the door for discussion about the talk. There is no limit on subject matter and topics will range from business ideas to cultural ideas to lifestyle ideas.
