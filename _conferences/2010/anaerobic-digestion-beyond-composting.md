Anaerobic Digestion is the process by which plant and animal material is
converted into methane and digestate for soil enhancement by naturally
occurring micro-organisms in the absence of air. The methane produced by AD
reduces fossil fuel use and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The material
left over at the end of the process (digestate) is rich in nutrients so it can
be used as fertilizer. AD is not a new technology – it has been used in the
Europe since the 1800s – and there are a growing number of AD plants in the
Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and the UK processing waste and producing energy.
Landfilling and composting organic waste releases vast amounts of greenhouse
gasses to the atmosphere. It is a waste of the energy potential as well as an
environmental tragedy. Burning the waste in an incinerator reduces the GHGs
emitted, but wastes the energy and organic potential of the feedstock. AD is
the choice of the future for British Columbia. This discussion will cover the
reasons AD is preferable to other ways of managing our organic wastes, and the
roadblocks and opportunities in developing a viable AD industry in British
Columbia.
