Foreign aid with intrinsic value rarely gets to people who need it most. Aid
with extrinsic value; value created by interacting with creative humans is
hard to misappropriate.  

Greg Mortenson is building schools in Central Asia, bringing education to
areas of the world past by modernity. He does it apolitically, with cultural
sensitivity, and most importantly, he is helping to educate girls. The problem
is, he is fighting the long defeat. In Pakistan alone, the need for new
schools every year is five times greater than all the schools Greg has built
in ten years. There is an obvious solution: crowd-source school construction?

We can provide tool libraries to communities using shipping containers. On the
Pacific Rim, there are over three million unused shipping containers; it’s
cheaper for companies to leave them in the country of landing than send them
back empty or partially filled. I want to take these containers, fill them
with the highest quality hand tools, and make them available to motivated
people. I want a program run by women. I want the tools to be run as lending
libraries. I want people to build their own future.
