There is a growing realization and a sense of urgency, in both governments and
civil society around the world, that, as a species, we must collectively
respond to climate change. Social justice and environmental sustainability are
now seen as key variables in achieving a livable planet. Often forgotten is
the third critical variable in this equation, a sustainable peace. Just as we
must support sustainable ecosystems and socio-political systems, so must there
be support for the creation of a sustainable architecture of peace. Without an
ability to transform conflict by peaceful means, we will be unable to create
just societies or positively transform our relationship to the natural world
and our life-support systems. In most discourse on climate change, peace is
seen as an outcome, rather than as a dynamic variable that conditions and
helps determine that outcome. This talk will consider the importance of
peacebuilding in addressing climate change.
