African Community Project (ACP) is the concept of Garry Brooks a retired
Canadian. Having gone to Zambia with Voluntary Services Overseas in 2002 as a
Community Developer and has continued ever since as a self funded consultant
to communities and Traditional Leaders. Since than his idea of community
forests has grown to the point of making sense to all involved. The project
brings together his knowledge and the communities wanting to become
environmentally sustainable. ACP will help any communities that ask for our
help. Be it providing clean drinking water, supply education supplies to
community schools or basic health needs. In turn we ask the community to
consider their environment around them and start improving it. This means
planting trees, addressing environmental issues like erosion and learning more
about global warming and climate change and how they can be part of a bigger
picture by doing their share. We are not a charity but we will help by showing
communities ways of becoming environmentally sustainable.
