There are two aspects to creative products. Physically, they are usually
simple: a reel of film, a CD, a computer disk, a sheet of printed paper. But
their value lies in their content, in their meaning, or what they represent.
The content could be a film, a story, a photograph, a game or a pop song, and
it might be entertaining or persuasive or informative or attractive. It is
this information that has value, not the physical object that carries it.

Because creative products are information-based, the rapid advance of digital
technologies and the globalisation of communications networks have made the
creative sector one of the fastest-growing in the world. Many of today’s most
successful companies are broadcasters, publishers, entertainers and games
designers, and they are growing fast. In the world’s advanced economies these
sectors are showing annual growth rates between 5 and 20%.  

The creative industry ecology is one of whales and plankton: a handful of
high-profile global players, stars and multinational companies, dependent upon
vast shoals of project-based micro-enterprises. From the surface, only the
bigger players are visible, but these big fish are wholly dependent on the
small fry further along the supply chain. New value is created in this sector
when technical innovation, artistic creativity and business entrepreneurship
are deployed together to make and distribute a new cultural product.
