As the flow of information continues to increase in our society, so does the
importance of psychological balance. The idea of psychological balance may be
a confusing concept, but the increasing speed of information in our culture
makes its relevance more important. An unbalanced automobile wheel may be
unnoticeable at slow speeds but becomes unmanageable at higher speeds, even
destructive. In effect, as the speed of cultural information increases,
without psychological balance, we may individually and collectively be subject
to a fate similar to an unbalanced wheel.

Inspired by the traditional model of an alpha particle (the nucleus of the
most abundant balanced element, helium) we present the simplest universal laws
and principles of psychological balance in a new model called the
Psychological Alpha Particle (PAP).

PAP offers a very powerful key for understanding psychological balance: the
discovery of universal mutual purpose and respect between objective and
subjective perspectives. It also provides a new mathematical framework for
empowering successful dialogue between apparently opposing views and unleashes
a revolutionary paradigm for empowering the successful evolution of
individuals and organizations.
