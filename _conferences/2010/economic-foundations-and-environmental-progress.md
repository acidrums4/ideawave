The current economic value system is in direct conflict with the progress of
the environmental movement. The scientific community and most of the public
are aware of the problems we have today. This is not a barrier, nor is finding
solutions through technology or lifestyle changes which have been addressed by
many creative and intelligent people. The problem we face is NOT a lack of
solutions but a means to implement them. Once we realize this, we can address
the main factor as to why we cannot implement suggested solutions: that the
green movement is bad for the economy.

Here is why: Making decisions with an arbitrary value system (money) corrupts
the problem-solving method. When analysing the merit of a decision that
impacts the real world, you need real value system (energy and natural
resources) to quantify these decisions. Money is circulated by jobs and
consumption. The more efficient and technologically advanced the culture, the
fewer people they need working. The economy rewards technological stagnation
in labour-saving devices and designed obsolescence. The economy suffers when
we are healthier, greener, and consume less. The solution is a movement away
from job dependant monetary circulation to a guaranteed livable income.
