What is cohousing? How does the design of Cohousing promote social capital and
community? How can participatory management and the creativity of permaculture
design be empowering and motivating to the elderly? How does the FUV aim to
create such an empowering environment?  

Cohousing is an innovative type of housing that offers many possibilities for
urban spaces, the environment and individuals as they age.  

Cohousing incorporates structural design features that aim to facilitate the
building of social capital and community, without compromising the privacy of
individual households. As an intentional community, Cohousers actively
participate in the process of design and management. Both cohousing and
permaculture based communities follow a set of principles that require
participation, ingenuity and creativity on the part of members. Participation
in these communities is found to be empowering to aging and disabled
individuals. In an aging population in need of empowerment/community, and in
an ecological environment in need of repair, permaculture/seniors based
cohousing communities offer a solution. The Fernwood Urban Village Cohousing
Community is in the process of developing just such an environment.
