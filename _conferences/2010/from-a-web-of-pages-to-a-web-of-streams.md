The structure of our identities are constantly evolving at the speed√Ç of the evolution of the Internet itself. The web site is no longer the only place to build your online reputation. It is becoming more apparent that the destination is less important than the artifacts along the way. We've moved from a web of pages to a web of streams in which your online identity and its subsequent creations live decentralized in various eco-systems, communities and contexts. Your stories --- whether as photos, audio/video, words or code --- live everywhere/nowhere. Not only in static destination pages per se, your stories are a combination of the footprints and interactions it leaves behind everywhere.
