OK, not the world, but EVs will empower consumers to slash their greenhouse
gas emissions. By switching to EVs, average household GHG emissions are cut by
over 40%. To make this possible, though, full-sized EVs must be as practical
as gasoline cars are today. Their other qualities will then motivate consumers
to go electric when replacing their cars. Cars now last an average of 13
years. Thus, EVs are a uniquely fast way to cut our emissions.

But to mainstream EVs, “range anxiety” must be eliminated. Range anxiety is
the fear that the car won’t get home without a long stop to charge the
battery. A solution is to operate fast electric re-charge stations, just like
gas stations today.

Fast Charge (FC) lets drivers enjoy the same convenience as today’s gas-
powered mobility. By pricing FC “mobile electricity” slightly lower than the
equivalent gasoline it replaces, funding becomes available to do great
benefit: keep home utility rates low, fund conservation and alternative
energy, motivate retailers and wind down government’s dependency on gasoline
taxes --- meanwhile financing investment in FC stations. BC could make use of
the real value of mobility to catalyze the future Green Economy.
