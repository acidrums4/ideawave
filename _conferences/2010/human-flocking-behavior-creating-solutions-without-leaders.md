From the play of fashion to the plague of fascism, from sporting events to
stock market bubbles, humans engage in flocking behaviors. How does this
unconscious drive affect our lives and our world?  
This presentation will use practical examples to explore:

* How the flocking instinct operates in animals, including humans
* How flocking behavior can make it harder, or easier, for people to accept new ideas
* Tipping points in the movement of the human flock
* Using flocking to empower the leading edge of social change movements
