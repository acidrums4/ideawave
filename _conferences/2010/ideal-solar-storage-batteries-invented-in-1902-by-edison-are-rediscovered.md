The topic will include the history of these batteries which were invented by
Edison in 1902. In 1972 the Exide Battery Company bought the technology from
the Edison Storage Battery Company and immediately took them off the market &#8230;
just before solar energy became practical. Ian will be discussing this
history, showing example batteries and showing pictures of the system
installed in his house.
