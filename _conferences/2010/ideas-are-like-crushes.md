New ideas are like crushes. Your palms get a little sweaty, your heartbeat
increases, and you can’t help but think about the possibilities the future
holds for you two. Yes, you and your idea. You’re always thinking about your
idea. You have notebooks full of all the things you could do together but
you’re too nervous to initiate anything. Maybe you’re afraid of rejection,
maybe you enjoy keeping your idea a secret, not telling anyone about it, for
fear that they will steal it away from you. A crush is just a crush until you
do something about it and an idea is just an idea until you do something about
it. Take the risk and ask out your idea.

This talk will be focused on acting on ideas and turning them into something
tangible. Touching on: why an idea should be shared with everyone and not be
kept as a secret.
