Imagine a community like Victoria who builds a chain of renewable energy
products for the energy market that includes electricity, heat and biofuels
all generated from local renewable biomass feedstock and other renewable
inputs. This is now possible and has been accomplished by the City of Gussing
in south east Austria. The primary generator is a sophisticated gasification
reactor that generates Producer gas, heat and electricity and with these
outputs has taken the City of Gussing right off the grid. In Gussing the
gasification technology is supported by wind, solar and other biological
systems to generate a mixed supply of renewable energy sources that now
enables the town to export energy into the regional electricity distribution
grid. The cost of energy in Gussing has remained stable since 2000 while
fossil energies have risen by more than 500% in the same period. In addition
to the renewable energy generation more than 150 research projects have been
developed, over 1250 jobs created and Gussing is now the Center for Renewable
Energy in Europe.  
This presentation will follow the renewal of Gussing commencing in 1995
through to today, share the benefits and explore the opportunities that this
technology offers for North American communities. It will outline an
integrated utility model that addresses the local demand for energy and relies
on local renewable resources, skills and talent and community aspirations that
are key components to success.
