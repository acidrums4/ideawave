Positive images are important as guides towards sustainable and just futures
as well as being useful in helping us face what is not working in our
communities and institutions today. The dominant forces urge us not to be
visionary, but to simply, easily, effortlessly accept how society is now
rather than what it could be. I argue that it is important that, rather than
simply accept the foreboding images, we actively pursue creating positive
images of alternative futures. As Meadows, Meadows and Randers (1991: 225)
argue, “a sustainable world can never come into being if it cannot be
envisioned. Positive images of sustainable futures, visions, are potential
catalysts and guides in making change happen, by providing futures worth
working for.

Elise Boulding tell us (1988: 90) that “imagining future sustainability
different from the present is one our greatest problems as a society”. We have
lost our ability to envision anything different from the present. The
corporatised media, governments, corporate business, the design industry, many
futures oriented professionals and scientist have converged and conflated “the
future” into a more or less singular image of a nature-less future --- one that
is lacking both ecological and human diversity. While negative pronouncements
are necessary, they are simply not sufficient to make positive change happen.

Ecologist Stephen R. Carpenter (2002:2079) suggests that the “unrelenting
negativity has an effect on listeners that may be different from our intent.
Constructive solutions that evoke optimism may come closer to our goals”. I
will explore how negative imagery may be interfering with our ability to
create visions that could evoke optimism. And to explore how we can assert
space for diverse images of the future based on sustainable and just
communities, both human and nonhuman, that will guide meaningful efforts
directed towards sustainability.
