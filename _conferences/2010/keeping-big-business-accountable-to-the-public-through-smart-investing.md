There is much cynicism and suspicion around large businesses and their
willingness to be accountable to the public. And why should they? The
concerned public does not own the company- the shareholders do. But what
happens when the concerned public is the shareholder? How does being involved
with a business ---rather than rejecting it--- allow you to impress your values on
daily operations? Can shareholders effectively facilitate positive change from
within rather than by pushing from the outside? This talk will examine how
individuals can have impact on business practices by involving themselves at
an investment level. By using their portfolio to vote with their dollars,
concerned citizens can help push companies to find a better way forward both
environmentally and socially.
