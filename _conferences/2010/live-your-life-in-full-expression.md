My talk will focus on how to harness our life energy and direct it towards
what is most meaningful and important to us, our families and our communities.
I will provide a perspective on the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual
aspects of ourselves and talk about ways to connect to these aspects. I will
also share an approach to managing the indicators of imbalance that show up in
our lives, whether it be financial lack, disruption in relationships, health
concerns, or feelings of discontent, boredom, anxiety, anger or guilt.
