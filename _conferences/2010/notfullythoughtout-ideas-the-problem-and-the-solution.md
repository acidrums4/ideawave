As we gather to celebrate a host of new ideas that will undoubtedly prove to
be of great benefit to our society, we must not forget that over the centuries
there have been ideas that have not served mankind well. These ideas have
ranged from the downright evil, to the poorly thought-out, and to the
amusingly stupid. And sad to say, these less-than-beneficial ideas continue to
emerge and to gain acceptance among a large segment of our society. Can
anything be done about this ever-challenging problem?

This presentation offers a solutionâ€”one that caring, intelligent, and serious-
minded individuals will find acceptable whatever their political or
philosophical persuasions. All that is required of those who would implement
the solution here presented is imagination, a sense of humour, and an abiding
love for the African Rhinoceros. (Diceros bicornis bicornis.)

**Desmond Lindo** shares many personal traits and characteristics with the
African Rhinoceros. Short-sighted and incredibly thick-skinned, he possesses a
cranium designed by nature for butting heads, which he loves to engage in with
other obtuse individuals.  
A former long-time resident of Victoria, his current roaming territory is the
intellectually-barren veldt of the Comox Valley. He charges down to Victoria
from time to time to feed on its lush intellectual greenery.
