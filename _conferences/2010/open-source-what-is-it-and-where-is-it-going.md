Imagine a world where millions of people get paid to give their work away for
free. This sounds crazy, but it’s real, it’s called Open Source, and it’s how
the majority of corporate software budgets are being spent in 2010. Open
Source is a buzzword that many are familiar with, but what does it really
mean? Why are people so excited by it? And how can businesses possibly make
money when they are giving it all away? We will explore what Open-Source is as
well as its relationship with the Open-Standards, Open-Data and free-software
movements. Gazing into the future, we will use our crystal ball to look at
where the open-source movement is going, and the impacts it will have on the
way we work, play, and live.
