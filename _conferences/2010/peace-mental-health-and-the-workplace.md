> Where does global destruction start? I propose that while problems such as environmental disasters, wars and child labour may have many beginnings, it is typically at the workplace where the flame of death, war and violence is fanned and nurtured so that it breaks out into a full-blown fire. The BP oil spill, Bhopal, and even the Air India crash all sprung, in one way or another, from decisions and omissions in the workplace. I further propose that these disasters happen because workplaces are typically dysfunctional. Turf wars, lack of concern for safety and an aversion to taking responsibility for the consequences of people's actions, to name only a few examples, are considered normal in most workplaces. This is dysfunctional, it is unhealthy. It lacks mental health.

> My idea is to invite participants to become aware of the wide spectrum of mental health, from managing chronic mental illness to fostering vibrant mental health take responsibility for their individual mental health in the workplace take responsibility for their part of the mental health of their workplace as a whole.
