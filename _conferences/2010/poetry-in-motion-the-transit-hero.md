Last fall I heard an extraordinary spoken word artist, Canadian slam poet
Shane Koyczan, who uses hip hop style sounds and cadence to engage his
audience with topics that are important. Fast forward to January, when I was
contracted to manage the delivery of a mixed media campaign for BC Transit;
they needed to reinforce the value of taking public transit as an
environmental choice. We wanted to recognize and appreciate the riders and ask
non-riders to consider public transit in a different light. Originally
directed to produce a radio jingle I proposed to use poetry and Shane’s talent
instead to emotionally connect with BC Transit riders and potential riders.
Meanwhile the world was watching BC and at the 2010 Olympics Opening
Ceremonies Shane spoke a poem commissioned by the Canadian Tourism Commission
in 2007, “We are More”. Thanks to that amazing performance it was an easy
decision to ask him to write and perform “Transit Hero”. Shane wrote and
performed the spots within three weeksof my first call to him. The results
have been incredible and I will expand on the way this campaign has touched
not only external audiences but internal as well – creating a sense of pride
and commitment to the planet.
