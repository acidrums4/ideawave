Our idea is that we are at a stage now where we have moved beyond the
information age and we need deep, personal and collective transformative
processes to face the immense challenges of our generation --- global warming,
child poverty, the AIDS Pandemic. We need more meaningful and fierce
conversations that require deep engagement and the means to record and
communicate on intuitive levels across a broad spectrum. These conversations
are more than information sharing. The challenges we are facing now require us
to honour the past, take stock of the present and approach the future with a
spirit of playfulness, spontaneity and innovation. We see the ability to play
with ideas and possibilities as a vital component of social and organizational
transformation. Visual records make visible the more subtle forces that shape
conversations --- the emotions, energy levels, and passion behind the project or
story. There are tremendous benefits: complex issues are broken down into
simpler components; roles are clarified; past events are put into perspective;
dynamics are brought out into the open; long-term direction is laid out and
requisite steps mapped, and lastly, most importantly, the real purpose and
intent behind the conversation can be made visible and therefore conscious.
