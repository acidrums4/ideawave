There is no concept of Mutual Strategy in Physics, Math or any other science.
Game theory is the only science that facilitate modelling of Mutual Strategy.

There is no easy way without game theory modelling to study human societies
and interactions among people. Respect is the most fundamental mutual strategy
in human relations. I will talk about the importance of scientific definition
of Respect in societies and how it will contribute inresolving ever growing
conflicts in the world.
