When was the last time you got excited about conflict and the possibilities it
provided? We’re not talking here about a perverse enjoyment but rather a
creative engagement that calls us to step into a more evolved and upgraded
version of ourselves.  
For time immemorial, we humans have had a love-hate relationship with
conflict, trying to come to terms with it both by searching out ways to
increase levels of peace and harmony in our homes, communities and the world
at large as well as equipping ourselves with the arsenal to engage in full-out
combat. Perhaps we might be better served by investigating our relationship
with conflict itself and realizing the very real potential it offers for being
a force for greater good. Like change, conflict is inevitable. It simply is.
Like it or not, conflict is part of our lives and it’s a good thing … because
at certain times, the best way to innovate and break free from the limitations
of the status quo is to cross swords. Come hear what Rachelle has to say about
becoming a master swordsman/woman in an age where the only outcome of real
merit is one that ensures everyone comes out a winner.

[ Rachelle
Lamb](http://www.rachellelamb.com/),
speaker, author and president of Mindful Communication, has offered her
engaging communication and personal development talks and trainings to
thousands in both the public and private sectors. Conflict and personal
transformation have been her path for most of her life. By examining the
communication habits and interpersonal dynamics that come into play when
conflict arises in people’s lives and by applying certain tools that enhance
precision and clarity, she helps individuals, couples and professional teams
learn how to harness disparate energies into a deeper unified vision that
inevitably leads to breakthroughs. Her ongoing commitment to helping
individuals and organizations maximize their potential in both their personal
and professional lives have earned her accolades in her field. Audiences
consistently remark on the profound life-changing impact of what they learn in
her talks.
