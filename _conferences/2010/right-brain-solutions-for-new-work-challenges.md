To be competitive in the global economy, the Pew Center asserts that right
brain innovative capability must be used to do NEW WORK — because “left brain”
routine work will be outsourced more and more to countries where there is
cheaper labor to do these routine jobs. This is especially important for
Canada, which ranks 14th in Innovation amongst 17 peer nations, according to a
recent Conference Board report (the USA ranks 3rd). To meet this challenge,
different kinds of Knowledge Solutions can be used for different purposes. For
example: Reciprocal knowledge exchange between researchers with chemical and
electronics backgrounds enabled Eastman Kodak to create hybrid products for
the digital age. Knowledge transfer from C-level officers (CEO, CFO, etc.) to
lower-level positions ensured retention of critical organizational knowledge
needed for successful succession planning at Sony Electronics and Winthrop
Pharmaceuticals. Knowledge harvesting of the unique problem-solving ability
and practices of each independent researcher at AIL Systems generated
additional business. Knowledge sharing between departments (e.g., Sales and
Finance) and between management and labor overcame “silo thinking” at CSX
Transportation to produce innovative services for customers and profits for
shareholders. Knowledge translation converts knowledge and creative ideas into
new products; AT&T did this to get new and better consumer products to market
faster.
