The talk will begin by mixing a litre of used vegetable oil with an alcohol-
based catalyst in a pop bottle, and the audience will then witness the
reaction --- separation of the biodiesel phase from the glycerin phase.

The talk will discuss the Island Biodiesel co-op’s mixed benefits: activity as
a legitimate ‘business’, providing income for local co-op members, while
serving as a form of environmental and community activism by reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, keeping energy dollars in the local economy, and
keeping those same dollars from going to the petroleum industry.

The talk will also describe the lessons learnt by the speaker, including: the
future is dirty, not clean, and we better learn to start cleaning up our
messes (from fuel waste, to agriculural waste, to our own excrement); the
current hostility facing the renewable energy sector in BC, especially in
regards to increasingly hidden subsidies to the petroleum industry, the
questionable environmental benefits of new Hydro initiatives, the desire to
overturn the ban on drilling and oil tanker traffic; and the ongoing
relinquishment of commitments to renewables.

In particular, the current new carbon tax makes the fossil carbon in biodiesel
taxed over 17 times higher than in petro-diesel. Finally, the talk will
conclude with a desciption of the skills required for the new job
opportunities which will unfold over the next century --- not engineers or
consultants, but composters, cleaners, recyclers, janitors and salvagers.
