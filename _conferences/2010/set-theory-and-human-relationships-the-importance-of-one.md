When her beloved husband, Yves Loran, died in 2001, Janis La Couvée and her
sons were puzzled by the enormous sense of loss in their family relationships.
How could losing just one family member in a group of four explain it? Why did
they feel like they were missing more than ¼ of their family? Somehow, there
needed to be a logical answer. Then, one day --- it came to her! Set theory.
Join Janis as she explores the dynamic of one and its importance in our human
and community relationships and networks. If you’ve ever wondered why one
guest can bring a party to life --- this talk is for you.
