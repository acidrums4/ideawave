The goal: a car accessory system that mounts on the outside of a car wheel
that lets you drive the car either on electricity with the key on “ACC” or on
gas as usual, turning the car into a sort of a plug-in electric hybrid. I’m
doing this system as “open technology” – no patents. I started Jan. 2008.

The components of the system are:  

What’s done so far:  

The potential: Turn 250 million cars into plug-in hybrids. 100 billion dollars
in Canada alone, of various potential business opportunities for small
businesses everywhere to make the various components and install them, without
involving the big corrupt special interests, who are not on our side.
