As someone who works with food everyday, I am always intrigued to see what new
food products emerge on the market. Recently there seems to be a spate of
foods in various states of preparation. The commercials for each (in true
infomercial fashion), show a harried working mother, worrying endlessly
through her day about how she will endure the terrifying ordeal of
peeling/chopping/cooking a nutritious serving of mashed
potatoes/broccoli/lasagne for her poor family. And thus, convenience food is
borne.

By no means is convenience food a brand new product on the horizon, but it
does seem to have exploded in terms of shelf-space at the same rate as our
lives become more complicated. As a former recovering economist, and now as
someone who works with food daily, I have many questions about the opportunity
costs associated with such products, not the least of which is the self-doubt
about our own instincts around feeding ourselves that many of these products
help perpetuate.

This discussion originally began on social media, prompted by a passing
comment about one of these commercials. I think its worth more than an
exchange of comments and has multiple repercussions, how about you?

Mansfield](http://www.realfoodmadeeasy.ca/)
began Real Food Made Easy, a personal chef and glutenfree baking service after
working for 18 years in government as an economist. In her business, she
brings a love of growing and preparing food, with an insatiable desire to
fully research as many aspects of food production and preparation as humanly
possible!
