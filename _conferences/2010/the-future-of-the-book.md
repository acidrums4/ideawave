Libraries continue to spend billions each year on paper books, but things are
clearly changing. Electronic books are becoming a bigger slice of the pie, and
massive digitization efforts by Google and others are creating online
collections to rival the greatest libraries in the world. But the future of
the book is about more than just a transition from print to screen. Itâ€™s about
a transformation in the way that ideas are communicated. In a world where
scholarship is happening less-and-less between the covers, what becomes of the
book? And as research moves increasingly online, what will the written record
look like to the scholars of the future?
