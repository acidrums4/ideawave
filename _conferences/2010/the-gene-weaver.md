One stunning discovery of this biotech century is the idea that DNA (nature)
is not our master, that we can in fact influence our destiny by influencing
the expression (nurture) of genes in our genome. The controls that regulate
our gene expression are collectively called the epigenome, and the science is
called epigenetics.  
Thoughts, words, actions, emotions, stress, childhood abuse, diet and
meditation have all been found to change gene behaviour, and thus our health
and vulnerabilities. These changes can be transferred to our children and
grandchildren, so therapists and researchers are eagerly pursuing ways of
reversing unhealthy gene expressions. We are now on the threshold of
leveraging this idea into action: by adopting a positive lifestyle, we can
change our personal world one gene at a time.
