The modern War on Drugs has continued for roughly forty years and yet victory
remains distant. Despite decades of heavy enforcement, today illegal drugs are
cheaper, stronger and more available than ever before. In recent years, the
Canadian government has tried to follow the United States by legislating
minimum jail sentences for certain drug offences. First there was bill C-26,
then bill C-15 and now bill S-10. There is no evidence to prove these
mandatory sentences will reduce drug trafficking, but there is evidence to
suggest that increased drug enforcement will result in higher levels of black
market violence. In this context it becomes clear that gradually ending drug
prohibition is the key to criminal justice reform. Only then can we regulate
the consensual adult behaviour surrounding drug use, refocus scarce law
enforcement resources and ultimately address the serious problem of drug
addiction in our society.
