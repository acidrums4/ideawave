here comes a point in your life when it is over. Death has taken your final
breath and you are gone. What happens next? Can you help your family without
being there? How do you make it easier for them at this difficult time? Sue
Daniels-Ferrie speaks from personal experience, offering suggestions, advice
and a step by step directional guide, to take you and your family through
unfamiliar territory. A tour guide for a journey, through a place, many don’t
want to talk about. Death&#8230;your death. You can’t avoid it yet you can make it
easier on those left behind. Moving, funny, informative and down to earth. A
talk you won’t want to miss!
