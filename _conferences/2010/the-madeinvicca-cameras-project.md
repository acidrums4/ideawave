I created the madeinvic.ca 100 Cameras project. The project’s first conception
came from months, and years, of listening to complaints, self-deprecating
jokes that had ceased to be jokes, and general malcontent for the city of
Victoria. The phrase “no fun city” that was supposed to be tongue in check but
was more like straight from the horse’s mouth. I started to ask “what is going
on in Victoria? What, if anything, do people love about Victoria?”, then
quickly realized how ill equipped and informed I was to answer that. So how do
you get an answer few can argue against without incentive? Take pictures. A
lot of pictures.

The project design parameters didn’t make it any easier. We couldn’t
incentivize participation without it becoming a contest, we couldn’t make it
strictly digital submissions, collect through an aggregating service like
flickr or photobucket, or open submissions. We had to remove all barriers to
participate while enforcing a set of parameters on the submissions without
stating them while excluding the fewest number of people. A low tech, low
fidelity solution seemed like the most elegant. We gave out 100 disposable 400
speed film cameras with the instructions “interpret and photograph what ‘made
in Victoria’ means to you, bring the camera back when you’re done; of those
100, 50 have come back. All of the images received are viewable at
www.madeinvic.ca where participants were given the opportunity to comment on
their own images.

The Cameras produced some insightful and interesting results, both in the
images created and the discussion around them. I would like to share some of
the images and stories from the project and the challenge of engaging the
public without direct benefit or incentive to participate.
