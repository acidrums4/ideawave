This summer, I am building a 500′ long monorail for Burning Man. It will be an
ephemeral public transit system that will transport the citizens of Black Rock
City from Nowhere to Nowhere for 5 nights, then burn to the ground and
disappear without a trace. It will engage its participant’s thinking about
public transit, framing the question: how can we build truly functional, well
integrated transit systems that support our everyday metropolises.

Helen Cook’s title contains the word ‘engineer’, and she is very
excited about finally having the opportunity to drive a train.
