This summer, I am building a 500′ long monorail for Burning Man. It will be an
ephemeral public transit system that will transport the citizens of Black Rock
City from Nowhere to Nowhere for 5 nights, then burn to the ground and
disappear without a trace. It will engage its participant’s thinking about
public transit, framing the question: how can we build truly functional, well
integrated transit systems that support our everyday metropolises.

[Helen
Cook’s](http://monorail.nowhere2nowhere.com/)
title contains the word ‘engineer’, and she is very excited about finally
having the opportunity to drive a train.
