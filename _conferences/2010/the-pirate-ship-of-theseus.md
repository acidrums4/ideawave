What do greek mythology, pirates, and computing science have to do with each
other? Find out why a lay understanding of what a ‘copy’ is can lead to all

occasional entrepreneur, and an organizer of conferences. Occasionally
people even pay him. He serves as an example of why you should complete
your degree and get a real job.
