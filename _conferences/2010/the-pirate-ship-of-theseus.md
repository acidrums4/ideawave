What do greek mythology, pirates, and computing science have to do with each
other? Find out why a lay understanding of what a ‘copy’ is can lead to all

[Will Whittaker
](http://sketchfactory.com/) is a
software developer with very little focus, an occasional entrepreneur, and an
organizer of conferences. Occasionally people even pay him. He serves as an
example of why you should complete your degree and get a real job.
