> There’s no question that as the web emerged so did the genre sites for
productivity systems. From David Allen to Stephen Covey to Tony Robbins, there
are countless systems one can adopt. That said, very few people stick with
one; the human nature of the “achiever” instills an innate need to learn and
discover the latest new thing to learn and master. But the latest isn’t always
the greatest, especially when it comes to being productive. In fact, it
usually results in plain old lateness.

> The focus on productivity has become a suck unto itself; everyone trying to
get better and being more productive fall into two categories those doing and
those trying to do. Through the use of imagery, satire and pointing to
specific examples via my own “faux methodology” known as Eventualism, I’ll
show everyone why productivity, in fact, is a suck.
