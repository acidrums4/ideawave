The tracking accumulator is a low tech device for concentrating sunlight to do
useful work. It could cook food, heat water or air, power a fridge directly,
or be used as a mount for solar panels for maximum summer performance.  
The accumulator differs from most other solar concentrators in that the target
does not move (so stirling engines or a host of other applications can easily
be mounted and it works on a timer system. (Like that which is used on
telescopes because it is equatorial mount). It is also unusual in that there
are 2 half dishes mounted on the frame and 2 focuses. I designed the
mechanical mathematician, dripper trackers, clock based trackers and the
liquid piston tracker for the tracking solar accumulator project.  
The solar design t-square is used to design clam shaped solar cookers for
ideal unattended cook times.  
This is a humanitarian project. The goal is the provide the maximum sized
solar cooker to use all the sunlight for a defined time. So the cook can leave
the food and avoid being cooked herself!  
Also, the design process must be simple and cheap.

trained as a lab technician (applied biology) in Ireland, works as a stone
mason and invented the pulser pump in the late 1980s which is now being
researched in Queens University.
