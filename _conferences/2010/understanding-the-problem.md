In the 20th century, we learned how to move atoms. We got so good at it that
just about anybody in our part of the world can now get just about any atoms
they want, just about any time they want them.

Economic performance is thus becoming more of a question of form than it is of
quantity. Individuals and small groups have an unprecedented opportunity to
generate value for themselves and others, despite a caveat: While the variable
costs of doing business approach zero, the hunger for innovation places
unprecedented demands on the creative and problem-solving capacities of these
people.

Commerce, however, is still heavily couched in industrial-age language,
clumsily attempting to do business around activities that are wholly post-
industrial. Are we actually solving these problems, or are we trying to
shoehorn results into Procrustean parameters to satisfy employers, clients or
investors at our own expense and ultimately theirs?
