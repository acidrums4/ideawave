In the 20th century, we learned how to move atoms. We got so good at it that
just about anybody in our part of the world can now get just about any atoms
they want, just about any time they want them.

Economic performance is thus becoming more of a question of form than it is of
quantity. Individuals and small groups have an unprecedented opportunity to
generate value for themselves and others, despite a caveat: While the variable
costs of doing business approach zero, the hunger for innovation places
unprecedented demands on the creative and problem-solving capacities of these
people.

Commerce, however, is still heavily couched in industrial-age language,
clumsily attempting to do business around activities that are wholly post-
industrial. Are we actually solving these problems, or are we trying to
shoehorn results into Procrustean parameters to satisfy employers, clients or
investors at our own expense and ultimately theirs?

It is said that artists starve, so I chose computers instead. Since I began my
career in 1999, I’ve done everything from system administration to graphic
design to writing web apps and big-data business intelligence systems. There
are a few epithets that describe my body of expertise, but the nice one is
“self-directed learner”. I hung up my spurs as a security developer near the
end of 2007 to integrate what I had learned programming with what I am
learning in user experience design, business and management, and to set about
tackling what I believe are some serious problems addling the increasingly
important business of realizing software.
