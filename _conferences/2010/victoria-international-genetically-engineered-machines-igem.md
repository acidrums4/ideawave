IGEM is a competition in which students create genetically engineered machines from a standardized set of parts. The local IGEM group is in its second year, our last years project was about, creating a NAND gate and coupling the output to Fluorescent proteins. The 2010 project is to use signaling molecules to create a network out of different strains of E.Coli.
