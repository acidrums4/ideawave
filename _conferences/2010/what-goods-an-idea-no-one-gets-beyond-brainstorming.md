This talk will be separated into two 5 minute talks!

_What good’s an idea no one gets? Some solutions_

Visit this session for a snapshot of the fascinating things about ideas that
die or bloom on the vine. The picture includes: whoever tells the best story
wins&#8230; emotions trump logic &#8230; competition in Darwinian free markets&#8230; unsticky
ideas.

In a mere 10 minutes, we’ll slice through some of these challenges and look at
what the research plus social experiments reveal about the highs and lows of
people with great ideas that either engaged (or didn’t) their audiences.

_Beyond brainstorming: there’s more than 1 way to problem-solve_

Noting a strong tendency many people have to quickly opt for brainstorming as
a way to spur creativity and problem-solve, Marilynne wondered if good
marketing by gurus has gotten in the way of our selecting the best approach to
match the challenge? Have we let our desire for “the quick fix” get in the way
of even better solutions? Which methods do a better job of promoting
creativity and problem-solving when we work alone and which help us when we
work in groups?

Three years ago, she decided to wade through the tangle of hundreds of
techniques, approaches, models and principles on the market looking for the
overlaps, limitations and strengths of each to answer some of the preceding
questions.

Out of her research has come a fresh synthesis of insights on the way the
field is organized and the very human desire to get good answers to problems
when crunch time comes.
