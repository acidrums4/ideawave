Subtext on the title: The Power of Curiosity and Personal Story

Lives and experiences are being transformed by powerful questions. These can
be used for personal reflection, or connection with others. It’s all based on
the belief that everyone has a story worth knowing and sharing.. We’ll look
how to craft the questions that bring out the ‘golden stories.’ This is a
highly engaging presentation with immediate implications and applications for
personal and business life. We will look at some of the 18 ways that asking a
good question can help in whatever setting you find yourself in.

After a career teaching in public schools, Christopher Bowers is now Executive

ConversationWorks.ca. He’s been called the Story Catcher of Victoria. He works
with education, business and community organizations to understand the power
of great questions and the resulting personal story. His program is designed
to give students, and the public, a better understanding of how the wider
world works.

Christopher also coordinates Green Drinks Victoria, a network that supports
sustainable business and community development. In addition to the monthly
Green Drinks at The Oswego Hotel, he moderates the Green Drink Network of

the community.

His latest initiative is the launch of What’s Gone Well Today.com… a new way
to shift thought.
