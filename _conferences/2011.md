On February 26 and 27th, 2011, hundreds of critical thinkers, from inventors to philanthropists, will come together for a second time to share ideas and engage each other in dialogue about ideas and their place in the world.

IdeaWave is a forum where critical thinkers are able to mix and mingle in a highly engaged environment.

Each day starts at 9am (registration at 8:30am on the 26th!) and consists of a series of 25 talks, each 10 minutes in length. Talks are designed to be a snapshot of the idea and to open the door for discussion about the talk. There is no limit on subject matter and topics will range from business ideas to cultural ideas to lifestyle ideas.

The conference will be held at the [Comfort Hotel & Conference Centre](http://www.choicehotels.ca/en/victoria-hotel-comfort-british_columbia-cn904-en?tab=0&cid=20570) in Victoria, BC. Mention IdeaWave when youâ€™re reserving your room for a 10% discount. Parking is included for all attendees.

The following list of talks for the 2011 conference is updated as we accept talks, so check back regularly.
