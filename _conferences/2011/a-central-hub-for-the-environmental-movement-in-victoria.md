The Integreen Foundation is a non-profit organization designed to create a
central hub for the environmental movement in Victoria, BC. There are two main
focuses of this organization at the moment, one being a website and the other
an innovative concert series that is designed to engage people in
environmental activism.

The purpose of Integreen is to create a space where citizens can become more
active in bringing positive change to their community. Integreen brings
together all facets of activism through networking, collaborative action, job
and volunteer matching.

_Update_: Integreen has been re-branded as [Social Coast](http://socialcoast.org/).
