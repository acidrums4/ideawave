With a continually growing population combined with a growing concern over
current policing trends, a critical analysis of our deployment model and its
relationship to the community is essential. An in depth look at current and
future policing trends, based on information and research, including that of
Supt. Chris Braiden (ret.) of Edmonton Police Service, leads this discussion.
Police organizations must come to the realization that there is a need for
allies and friends to guide the growth of law enforcement organizations. There
needs to be a paradigm shift from a model of “service”, to one of empowerment
of citizens to drive the change they want to see in their communities.
