A practical proposal for increasing the effectiveness of democracy, through
use of a simple and effective evolutionary change in the voting process.
Suitable for any democratic group, from the smallest club to the largest
nation.

Increase the value and accuracy of voting as a measure of political
preferences while simultaneously decreasing undesirable distortions introduced
by strategic voting and other non-optimal democratic decision-making
strategies.

A simple and effective way of improving the way we govern ourselves in any
democracy, laying the foundation for ongoing improvement by natural
preferential encouragement of ethical political action.
