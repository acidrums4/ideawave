A practical proposal for increasing the effectiveness of democracy, through
use of a simple and effective evolutionary change in the voting process.
Suitable for any democratic group, from the smallest club to the largest
nation.

Increase the value and accuracy of voting as a measure of political
preferences while simultaneously decreasing undesirable distortions introduced
by strategic voting and other non-optimal democratic decision-making
strategies.

A simple and effective way of improving the way we govern ourselves in any
democracy, laying the foundation for ongoing improvement by natural
preferential encouragement of ethical political action.

Committees. I know the political party system and how it actually works (or
does not work), and why it inevitably leads to the type of politics (and
politicians) we all love to hate.

refining, analyzing and correcting complex digital information systems in
small to medium size organizations.
