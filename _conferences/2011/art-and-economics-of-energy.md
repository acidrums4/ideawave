Energy today is often dirty, war-causing, climate changing and dominated by
multinationals.

Imagine a world where energy connected us to the most ancient teachings across
cultures.

Imagine communities owning their own power, creating good green lasting jobs
and an economic platform that can sustain.

Imagine energy tied to culture, touched by artists, energy that heals the
earth, heals communities and inspires the spirit is possible.

Learn about people that are reinventing the world and the future through
energy art and economics that heal.
