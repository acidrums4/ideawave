Back in November many people were asked to refrain from using social media for
a day to show sympathy and raise awareness for the social isolation of
autistic people. What these people may not have understood is that many
autistic people are no longer isolated thanks in large part to social media.

Thanks to sites such as Twitter, Facebook, LiveJournal and other blogging
sites, autistic people can meet others on the autism spectrum, share ideas,
learn about autism and how it affects them, and even arrange to meet face to
face. Some people have met and married others on the spectrum after meeting on
social media sites.

In this speech I will talk about how I, an autistic person, and other people
on the autism spectrum benefit from the use of social media.
