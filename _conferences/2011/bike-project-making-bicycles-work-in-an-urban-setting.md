The genesis of the “Bike Project” was a panel discussion on “Green Futures:
not the Soylent Green variety” at V-Con 34 conference in Vancouver, October
2009\. An audience member addressed the panel to general applause: “We already
know how to recycle and make our own choices to live greener,” he said. “What
we want is to know how we --- the hundred people in this room --- can fix the
things that other people, corporations and government, are doing wrong, and
help them do the right thing.”

The “Bike Project” is a response to this mandate, collecting resource material
into a format accessible to ordinary readers. This resource material will have
information intended to empower people to make their communities places where
bicycles can and will be used. Readers will know how other people have
succeeded in increasing bicycle usage and safety, making bike lanes and bike
paths, building mountain bike tracks and velodromes and skateparks, and
operating shared bike programs. This project is not an exhaustive
encyclopedia; it will be a pocket toolkit to get readers started on their own
projects without re-inventing the wheel. The “Bike Project” was awarded a
Community Researcher Fellowship at UVic for 2011.
