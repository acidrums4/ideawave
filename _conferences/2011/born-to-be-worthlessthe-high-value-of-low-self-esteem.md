Contrary to conventional wisdom that self-esteem is a function of circumstance
or the luck of the draw, I will propose that self-esteem emerges in the course
of normal healthy development as a state of worthlessness or low self esteem.

Counter-intuitive as this may seem, it serves an adaptive purpose in hunan
relations. The problem is not low self-esteem per se, but rather failing low
self-esteem. In this short talk I will offer a glimpse into the possible
reasons for why and how low self-esteem is universally the preferred
psychological state for mankind.
