Community depends on networks, and the strength of these networks determines
the strength of all human enterprise: from business ventures to the
traditional barn raising or canning bee, or a multi-platform global
fundraiser. Yet how can we pre-determine the success or failure of a network?
Are there clues for us to consider? Janis will share lessons learned from many
decades of community building and organizing: from early days as a student in
France, to neighbourhood associations, the Blizzard of â€™96, and more recent
efforts involving both social networking and online communities. Learn how to
strengthen your pre-existing networks and build new ones on a solid
foundation.
