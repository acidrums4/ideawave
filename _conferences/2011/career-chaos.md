Why do people do the things they do? Because we are all following a pattern. We go to school, we learn, we follow instruction, we find out what we are good at, we get a job, maybe a career, and we live for the weekends. What if all of this was different? What if we could change the pattern? What if we even knew what the pattern was would that change the way we looked at the world? What if we lived with passion? What if we could live in a different way? Career Chaos is all about helping people sort through the mess called life, helping them figure out not only what their passions are but how to USE those passions.

Creativision has been creatively designing courses for individuals, teams, and organizations for years and have been having fun doing it. I would love to bring my passions to IdeaWave so that I can help others add a pulse to their passions.
