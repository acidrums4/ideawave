Adaptive Management is a framework for sustainability programs and
environmental management that emphasizes learning by management experiments.
Collaboration is the only way that large, complicated, multi-agency, and very
long programs can succeed. These two terms have become de rigeur for
environmental management, hence collaborative adaptive management is touted as
the way forward. But many ideas are operating here, and presentation of this
concept is typically confusing. Repairing confusion about adaptive management
processes is of critical importance. This talk points out the insightful
simplification of identifying four learning loops that build knowledge and
allow better decisions. Given that adaptive management is valuable to address
“wicked problems” of real-world management, this is an idea that will be
widely applicable.
