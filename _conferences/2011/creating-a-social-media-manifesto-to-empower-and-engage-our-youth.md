By their very nature, institutions are slow to react to changes in the
culture. This can be positive when protecting a culture from changes that are
fads, but it’s also very frustrating when it’s clearly well past time for some
significant change.

Canada, like many countries, is struggling with both educational reform, and
how to cope with social media in the classroom. These two issues are not
unrelated!

This talk will incorporate work by TED alumnus Sir Ken Robinson, social media
pundit Brian Solis, and educational psychologist Howard Gardner to provide a
foundation for further discussions on creating a “Social Media Manifesto to
Empower and Engage our Youth”.

<!--about-->

Before launching CampbellDuke Personal Branding, Beth
worked for a decade in the biotech sector, where she spent a significant
amount of her volunteer time tutoring adult literacy, working with the
regional science fair, and coordinating volunteers for the 24-Hour Relay for
Easter Seals.

Perhaps not surprisingly, she left biotech to “retool” as a high school
teacher and spent another seven years teaching. During the last 2 years of her
formal teaching career, she and a colleague took on the challenge of the
redesign and implementation of a Career and Academic Readiness program for at-
risk youth, re-engaging them in their own education by focusing on their
strengths and showing them that they could be successful in school and life.
