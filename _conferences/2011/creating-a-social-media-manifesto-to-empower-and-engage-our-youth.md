By their very nature, institutions are slow to react to changes in the
culture. This can be positive when protecting a culture from changes that are
fads, but it’s also very frustrating when it’s clearly well past time for some
significant change.

Canada, like many countries, is struggling with both educational reform, and
how to cope with social media in the classroom. These two issues are not
unrelated!

This talk will incorporate work by TED alumnus Sir Ken Robinson, social media
pundit Brian Solis, and educational psychologist Howard Gardner to provide a
foundation for further discussions on creating a “Social Media Manifesto to
Empower and Engage our Youth”.
