Often our ideas about our limitations are not based on any evidence but
certainly actively limit the possibilities of proving otherwise. Most people
think they canâ€™t write any poem nor are they motivated to do so. Yet, with a
simple format and a very short time-line (allowing no time to seed those
killer doubts, procrastinations and most importantly, endless whining), anyone
can write a surprising love poem to share with the object of their affection
at one of those special times. After being given the format, conference
participants will create their own love poem in 3 minutes. This leaves time
for 2-3 volunteers to come up and read. I will invite volunteers who wrote a)
something romantic they would be proud to share with their loved one b) a
humourous poem and c) a poem that expressed more hate than love (an option I
will cover in my introduction).
