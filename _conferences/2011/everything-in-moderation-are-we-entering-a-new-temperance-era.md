We have recently seen swings to the right in the political landscape, across
North America, and with that pendulum swing, we have also seen a rise in
concerns about consumption of products that are deemed harmful to ourselves
our society.  

One of those products coming to the fore again is alcohol, sparking public
debates about the dangers of alcohol consumption. Yes, there are definitely
tragedies to be avoided --- drunk driving, fetal alcohol effects to name two ---
but increasingly, opponents of alcohol consumption are teetering close to the
precipice of total abstinence. Alcohol is being demonized once again as the
root of all evil, and drink being cited as the start to a life of drug use.  

Perhaps this is human nature, to see things in black and white rather than
shades of grey, but those in charge of public policy making are also under
pressure to make parallel policy changes. We have been (unsuccessfully) down
the temperance road before.  

As a counter point, consider the fact that our ability to make alcohol has
meant the survival of the human race! What does temperance mean to you? Will
the cocktail be driven underground again?
