As any tree hugger will tell you, in a high wind trees move, they sway back
and forth. Tons of wood sways back and forth. My idea is to harness this
energy by wrapping trees with piezoelectric strips in a manner similar to a
maypole, that way a minor current is generated no matter the direction of the
wind. Connect a forest together and you have free power.
