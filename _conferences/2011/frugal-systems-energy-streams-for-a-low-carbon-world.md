I grew up beside the river Slaney in Ireland. It’s a typical Irish or British
rivers and it has abandoned mill sites every 6 to 10 kilometers for about 100
kilometers of its length. These were ALL Water Power sites with flour and
fiber mills driven by waterwheels 200 years ago.  
Oil made them uncompetitive and they all disappeared before 1970.  
Salmon disappeared in that river about 1980.  
New technologies have just arrived to bring riverpower and riverlife back.  
Zotloterer Gravitational Vortex Power Plants and the reverse Archimedes screw
or “hydro dynamic screw” are disarmingly simple.  
Apparently after more than 2000 YEARS someone noticed that Archimedes screws
would also work in reverse to PRODUCE power! They are now used in various old
mill sites in England, etc to generate electricity. Vortex power plants are
also spreading from Europe to Asia.  
How come we did not think of these things earlier? Lets think harder about
basic stuff.  
Lets make whole systems where waste streams are put back into the process!  
I will include a little about the pulser pump, fermentation powered pump,
their connection to the worldwide windowfarms project and about my solar
stuff. All frugal power projects!

**Brian White** is a stonemason in Victoria. My mum imparted her frugal
beliefs and my father gave me much more time to learn and play with my
projects than any overworked father should have.  
Laziness is a great motivator. I wanted an automatic watering system for my
garden. How do I get the water out of the stream and around the plants without
using energy and without having to haul it myself? A tiny ram pump that I made
failed after half an hour due to dirt in the clack valve.  
Ducks kicking up dirt!  
The quest for a “no moving part “duckproof” pump” led from coffee jar suction
pump to the “what the hell is this?” which I later renamed pulser pump. 20
years later, it has been replicated in England and a tiny research project in
Queens University, Ontario validated the concept. But nobody yet knows their
full capabilities.  
My solar projects are progressing slowly. Interest comes from Stirling engine
enthusiasts, aid workers etc. If I had more technical wherewithal, they would
be done now.  
Thanks to my family and friends, and ducks and those who encourage and argue
for getting me this far.
