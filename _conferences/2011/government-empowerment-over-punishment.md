In Victoria, the Hartland landfill is filling up faster than we thought it
would. Talks about charging by the pound for trash are floating around the
municipalities. This system would be in the millions of dollars and not really
address the issue. But this local issue is just a microcosm of how government
is dealing with its people. Too often the governments resort to laws that
punish people for bad behavior rather than trying to implement systems that
empower the people to change their behavior. Rather than spend millions on a
trash management system, how about we invest in composters and expand the
recycling system. Apartment building could create community gardens, people
could learn how to garden at home again and unwanted compost could be used by
local communities to have food co-op program. In short, communities could
create other initiatives to better the neighborhood around them rather than
waiting for the government to drop the big stick.
