In Spring 2010, Volunteer Victoria formed our Emerging Leaders Network, a network for the “next generation” of non-profit leaders to form connections with each other and learn how to be leaders in our sector. Now, after holding almost 40 successful Network events, we’d like to share what we’ve learned about emerging leaders and their needs, hopes, fears and challenges as they strive towards leading nonprofit organizations in the near future. No matter what sector you currently associate yourself with, or whether you consider yourself a leader or still heading in that direction, this talk will get you thinking about what leadership looks like today and where it’s headed in the future.
