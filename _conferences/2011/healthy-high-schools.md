In the education system, students are only required to take physical
education 9 & 10; they despise this requirement for the mundane activities
and unoriginal sports that gym teachers usually choose to teach. My talk
is the about the idea of combining a physical education and a health and
nutrition course for grades 11& 12\. After high school when students leave
home, they are required to keep themselves healthy by eating properly,
exercising on a regular basis, and balancing their course load. With
this course, students would learn the importance of a healthy lifestyle
and the skills to lead a more successful life post-secondary. The course
would introduce different types of physical activity that students may
have not been exposed to otherwise, for example curling or squash. This
could instill a lifelong interest for fitness and health and subsequently
be an advantage to the government because citizens would be taking care
of themselves and thus costing less to the healthcare system. This talk
would show the importance of wellbeing that is somewhat ignored by high
school students.
