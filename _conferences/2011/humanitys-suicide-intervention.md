While working on a Crisis Line in the East Kootenays, Robert learned to offer
a suicidal person an option for the future which the person may not have
considered. Some people say that humanity seems destined to commit suicide, so
Robert offers an option for the future which many people may not have
considered. All healthy human beings are born with two systems for relating
with their environment: a five-mode system of “hard-wired” sensors and nerves
for getting information about physical objects and events which can be heard,
seen, smelt, tasted and/or touched; and a multi-mode “wireless” system for
exchanging information with others about environmental states of being. Robert
draws from a wealth of experiences to describe the nature and application of
our in-born “wireless” information systems, which contain much more
information about our relationships with others, than can any number of spoken
words. He suggests ways for us to increase our awareness of this most
important communication ability, which all of us have, and asks us to choose
to stop being bullied into denying the existence of this ability and to use it
to help create peace, happiness and fulfillment in our lives.
