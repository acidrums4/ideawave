Feeling tired? Blue? Forgetful? Maybe less competent in bed as you used to be?

If you answered yes to any of these questions you could have depression,
bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s disease or good old sexual dysfunction, all
which could be vastly improved by taking a new and patented medication. Or at
least that’s what modern medicine wishes you to believe.

The problem is that much of modern prescribing is aided and abetted by the
pharmaceutical industry, a self-perpetuating cycle of “disease mongering,”
which offers a prescription solution to whatever illness, condition or concern
that comes our way.

How does one overcome cynicism and not throw the baby out with the snake oil?
Alan Cassels is no cynic, but he preaches a form of healthy skepticism --- a
vital, potentially life-saving habit of questioning pharmaceutical-driven
dogma and the medical profession who promotes it.

We know our doctors are altogether well-intentioned and many pharmaceutical
products are altogether efficacious, which is fortunate given most patient’s
implicit faith that medical treatment is a benefit. The rub happens on the
edges, where the yearning for easy medical solutions intersects with a
powerful and well-stoked profit motive that keeps us running for the
pharmaceutical cure.
