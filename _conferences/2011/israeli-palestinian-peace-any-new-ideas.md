The Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems intractable. Both peoples want the same
land, both have some valid claims to it, and both need a place to live. Many
ideas have been put forward, but none has yet resulted in a solution
satisfactory to all concerned. I have one idea to put on the table, and I’m
interested to hear yours. I will give a very brief review of the issues and
history, then present a possible map. Then invite comments and suggestions.
With so much current upheaval in the Middle East, we can hope there is a
chance for some positive change for all the peoples of that region.

**Lisa Tansey** – Born in Palo Alto, California – so started out seeing the US
as the center of the world. Then attended college in Canada, so got a broader
view of the world. Got a degree in biology & geography – love maps, love
electron microscope pictures! Have done many jobs – from cashier and waitress
to recombinant DNA jockey and Oracle DBA. Love DNA, love data!  
Started wondering about this question while working in Washington D.C. & saw
the actual EPA buildings; realized the government employees there had almost
no chance of knowing what they’d need to do regarding my San Diego
neighborhood!
