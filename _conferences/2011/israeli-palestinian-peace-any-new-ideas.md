The Israeli-Palestinian conflict seems intractable. Both peoples want the same
land, both have some valid claims to it, and both need a place to live. Many
ideas have been put forward, but none has yet resulted in a solution
satisfactory to all concerned. I have one idea to put on the table, and Iâ€™m
interested to hear yours. I will give a very brief review of the issues and
history, then present a possible map. Then invite comments and suggestions.
With so much current upheaval in the Middle East, we can hope there is a
chance for some positive change for all the peoples of that region.
