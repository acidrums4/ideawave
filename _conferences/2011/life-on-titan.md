> I’d like to talk about Titan’s duney “tidal marsh” seas, and life on Titan,
which space scientists have missed.

* Titan: the most Earthlike planet in the solar system besides Earth: air (22 PSI), seas, lakes, rivers (of liquid methane). 1/7 gravity, 30 year year, 16 day days, 1/3 of Earth’s temperature.  
* The gravitational workings of Titan’s once a day tides: why, the resulting fluid flows, the predictable and actual locations of the duney tropical seas and channels, Titan’s slow rotation.

Life:  

* Breathing gas is hydrogen, as recently discerned by scientists.  
	* Earth: C + O2 => CO2
	* Titan: C + 2 H2 => CH4  
* Cassini Spectroscopic results show abundant benzene, especially at shorelines.  
* Where Huygens landed: on top of a dune almost level with the sea surface.  
* Huygens GCMS results show organics and complex chemical activities occurring on Titan’s surface.  
* Huygens images show abundant aquatic vegetation that reveals the submerged dunes.  
* Cassini images show forests of giant trees, lakes of changing levels filled with vegetation, plain as day. River channels are marked by taller trees.

> Will bring pictures taken by spacecraft to illustrate.

<!--about-->

I’m one of Canada’s top inventors and the sometimes a
researcher. I’ve been studying worlds of our solar system whenever data
becomes available with special interest in the moons --- and _planets_
bigger than Mercury --- that orbit Jupiter and Saturn. I have followed
Galileo, Huygens and Cassini missions with great attention and have come
to see what I feel is the ‘big picture’ of the surface of Titan
and several other worlds, avoiding errors of narrow and uncorrelated
interpretation of data that space scientists have fallen victim to.
