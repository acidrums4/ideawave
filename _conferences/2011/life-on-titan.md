I’d like to talk about Titan’s duney “tidal marsh” seas, and life on Titan,
which space scientists have missed.


Life:  
Earth: C + O2 => CO2  
Titan: C + 2 H2 => CH4  

Will bring pictures taken by spacecraft to illustrate.

**Craig Carmichael** : I’m one of Canada’s top inventors and the sometimes a
researcher. I’ve been studying worlds of our solar system whenever data
becomes available with special interest in the moons – and _planets_ bigger
than Mercury – that orbit Jupiter and Saturn. I have followed Galileo, Huygens
and Cassini missions with great attention and have come to see what I feel is
the ‘big picture’ of the surface of Titan and several other worlds, avoiding
errors of narrow and uncorrelated interpretation of data that space scientists
have fallen victim to. See my CV at:
