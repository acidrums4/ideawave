There’s that dangerous work again&#8230;RISK. We’re taught to believe risk-taking is
scary, dangerous and irresponsible activity. The “what if’s” in life are
almost always negative and fearful. Not to mention that if you haven’t thought
of the “what if’s” on your own most people would be happy to point out the
worst case scenarios for you. The reality is with a simple approach to risk-
management many of these risks turn into opportunities.

I propose making friends with risk. Dare I even say making friends with risk
can even be&#8230; FUN! This may be the single most important life lesson I have
learned so far. I have continuously taken risks throughout my life, or perhaps
more accurately stated what most people perceive as risks, and this has led me
to some of the most amazing life experiences and dream jobs. Without taking
calculated risks in my life many of these amazing opportunities would never
have been a possibility for me. Making friend with risk can provide
significant advantages and open up opportunities that typically remain closed
to many individuals.

So here’s my suggestion: Stop being afraid of risk and befriend it instead!
