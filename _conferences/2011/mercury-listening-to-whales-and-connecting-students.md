The MERCURY project is a new research initiative that is building a
network of hydrophones to listen to the sounds of whales, dolphins and
other marine mammals in British Columbia. The network we are building
will have small, inexpensive and easily deployable hydrophones and will
have data centers located in schools both in urban areas but also in
remote regions, and will be both an educational as well as a scientific
endeavour, teaching students about whales and computers. It builds on
the legacy of the decades of work done by Dr. Paul Spong and Helena
Symonds, the founders of OrcaLab, a research station on Hanson Island,
a small island near the northern tip of Vancouver Island.

The researchers in MERCURY have previously developed [The
Orchive](http://orchive.cs.uvic.ca/), a website that makes available to
the public a huge archive of over 20,000 hours of orca vocalizations. The
MERCURY researchers are also involved with the VENUS and NEPTUNE projects,
a networked installation of ocean observatories. Unlike these massive
projects, MERCURY aims to leverage the latest advances in wireless and
hydrophone technology to quickly deploy a large network of small and
inexpensive remote sensing stations in a bottom-up approach.
