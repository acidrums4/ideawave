The MERCURY project is a new research initiative that is building a network of
hydrophones to listen to the sounds of whales, dolphins and other marine
mammals in British Columbia. The network we are building will have small,
inexpensive and easily deployable hydrophones and will have data centers
located in schools both in urban areas but also in remote regions, and will be
both an educational as well as a scientific endeavour, teaching students about
whales and computers. It builds on the legacy of the decades of work done by
Dr. Paul Spong and Helena Symonds, the founders of OrcaLab, a research station
on Hanson Island, a small island near the northern tip of Vancouver Island.
The researchers in MERCURY have previously developed [The
Orchive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413200031/http://orchive.cs.uvic.ca/),
a website that makes available to the public a huge archive of over 20,000
hours of orca vocalizations. The MERCURY researchers are also involved with
the VENUS and NEPTUNE projects, a networked installation of ocean
observatories. Unlike these massive projects, MERCURY aims to leverage the
latest advances in wireless and hydrophone technology to quickly deploy a
large network of small and inexpensive remote sensing stations in a bottom-up
approach.

[**Steven
Ness**](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413200031/http://sness.net/) is a
Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of
Victoria, studying sound with computers. He is the developer of [The Orchive
website](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413200031/http://orchive.cs.uvic.ca/)
and is involved in many other aspects of studying sound with computers. He is
passionate about understanding the languages of whales.
