The ability for organizations to tap into the collective wisdom, passion and
energy of their crowd will lead to success in an increasingly social
environment. Models and examples that will be explored include Crowdsourcing
product ideas, tapping the crowd to solve the problems in the community, and
Crowdfunding projects for charities and non-profits.

A look at challenges and best practices will round out the presentation to arm
participants with what they need to consider these tactics for their
organization.

<!--about-->

Paul Dombowsky has spent over 10 years in various marketing roles with
technology companies as well as TELUS Communications. It is here he
was bitten by the crowdsourcing bug and the potential that it offers
organizations to confidently embrace change that has input from the
crowd. Always entrepreneurial, Paul embarked on the development and
launch of a crowdsourcing and crowdfunding web applications with his
new start-up, Ideavibes, which has been developed as a social enterprise.

Paulâ€™s hope is that Ideavibes can be not only be a successful web
app company, but also act as an agent of change to help non-profits and
charities, as well as our communities, be more effective at helping make
the changes they need to succeed in their own right.
