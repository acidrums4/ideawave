The ability for organizations to tap into the collective wisdom, passion and
energy of their crowd will lead to success in an increasingly social
environment. Models and examples that will be explored include Crowdsourcing
product ideas, tapping the crowd to solve the problems in the community, and
Crowdfunding projects for charities and non-profits.

A look at challenges and best practices will round out the presentation to arm
participants with what they need to consider these tactics for their
organization.
