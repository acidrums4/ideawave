Why should we care about people who survive an earthquake who live half a
world away? Why should we care about anyone other than ourselves? These are
fundamental questions, the answers to which relate to politics, human rights,
and the survival of our species as a whole. In this ten minute talk, Greg
Bennick will explore the methods of psychological restraint that we
unwittingly employ that prevent us from caring about others and in fact cause
us to lash out against them. We will explore the idea that judgement and
restraint provides what feels like freedom, but in actuality keeps us bound
and unfulfilled in life and in ourselves. What are the psychological processes
that create this reality for us? This talk will be framed from the perspective
of Gregâ€™s eyewitness accounts of the events this year in Haiti after the
earthquake and his five trips there, and the reactions of those he has met
throughout the world during his efforts to elicit compassion and action on
behalf of survivors.
