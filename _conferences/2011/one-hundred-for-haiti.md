Why should we care about people who survive an earthquake who live half a
world away? Why should we care about anyone other than ourselves? These are
fundamental questions, the answers to which relate to politics, human rights,
and the survival of our species as a whole. In this ten minute talk, Greg
Bennick will explore the methods of psychological restraint that we
unwittingly employ that prevent us from caring about others and in fact cause
us to lash out against them. We will explore the idea that judgement and
restraint provides what feels like freedom, but in actuality keeps us bound
and unfulfilled in life and in ourselves. What are the psychological processes
that create this reality for us? This talk will be framed from the perspective
of Greg’s eyewitness accounts of the events this year in Haiti after the
earthquake and his five trips there, and the reactions of those he has met
throughout the world during his efforts to elicit compassion and action on
behalf of survivors.

<!--about-->

Greg Bennick is an American humanitarian activist, keynote speaker and
award-winning producer and writer. He is the founder of One Hundred For
Haiti, a direct action humanitarian aid organization helping people in
Haiti. He sailed to Haiti after the quake on a sailboat with 10,000 lbs
of food and medical supplies: this boat was the first private relief
boat to reach the southern coast of Haiti. Greg’s film work focuses
on projects which explore the human experience, including [‘Flight from
Death’](http://www.flightfromdeath.com), a seven-time Best Documentary
award-winning film narrated by Gabriel Byrne which uncovers anxiety about
mortality as a possible root cause of many of our violent and aggressive
behaviors. The film has been called “One of the most ambitious
documentaries ever made” by PBS Australia. The ideas in this film,
about how we see others and subsequently choose to engage with or ignore
them, will form the ideas about which Greg will speak at IdeaWave 2011.
