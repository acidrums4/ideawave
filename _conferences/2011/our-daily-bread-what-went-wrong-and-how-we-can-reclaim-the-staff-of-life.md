Since the 1960’s bread consumption in the western world has plummetted 50%.
During that time, wheat and grain allergies have increased exponentially.  

This talk will explore the correalation between industrial baking and the rise
of disease.  

We will ask questions about todays ‘Artisan’ bread movent and suggest ways
that we can support a move back to nutrional and well crafted baked products.
