The Augustana campus within the University of Alberta has undertaken a program
to systematically reduce the environmental impact of our IT infrastructure.
From printers to desktops to our server environment we’ve metered, measured
and found savings that surprised us. Through a few small tweaks and some major
architecture changes we’ve seen a decrease in power consumption of over
151,000 kWh/year. In this talk I will outline how we set about monitoring and
addressing power consumption, and lessons learned from the process.

**Josh Ryder** is the Manager of Technology and Learning Services at the
Augustana Campus, within the University of Alberta. With a background in
Computing Science (MSc. 2006), Josh has been interested in computers,
networks, and data security for years. He’s recently discovered a passion for
data center design, with a keen eye on power and cooling efficiency. Outside
of work you’ll often find Josh frequenting the better coffee establishments
where ever he travels, organizing wine summits, or laying down some hot laps
on the go-kart track.
