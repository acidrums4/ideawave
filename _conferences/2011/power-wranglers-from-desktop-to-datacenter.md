to systematically reduce the environmental impact of our IT infrastructure.
From printers to desktops to our server environment we’ve metered, measured
and found savings that surprised us. Through a few small tweaks and some major
architecture changes we’ve seen a decrease in power consumption of over

addressing power consumption, and lessons learned from the process.
