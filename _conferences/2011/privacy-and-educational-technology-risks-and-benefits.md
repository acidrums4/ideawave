What are the privacy implications to post-secondary institutions of using
services like Youtube, WordPress.com and Google apps in a learning
environment? BCcampus has collected examples to form a background paper on
this issue; some of the findings will be presented in this talk.

In order to match the expectations of students and instructors, as well as to
take advantage of the real cost savings, B.C. institutions are looking for
ways to bring these services into their teaching and learning processes.

Advantages: many of these services are free to use and offer powerful
web-based tools that can enhance education, partly because they are
familiar to students and will remain part of their working lives after
they leave the institution.

Disadvantages: there is increasing concern that U.S.-based “cloud” services
may not comply with of B.C.’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy
Act (FIPPA) if used in the context of formal academic work.

Are instructors refraining from using them no matter how much they enhance the
teaching and learning process?
