While volunteering at Kimuka Primary School in Kenya, I was in shock at the
lack of school supplies and text books the students had access too. Some
textbooks were being shared amongst 10 children at a time, and in order to
complete homework some children would have to run for miles to get access to a
text book. During class, the students would have to share pens and pencils
which made note taking very difficult. Not only were the children in need of
supplies and books, the ones they did have were tattered and very worn over
years of use. These conditions would only make obtaining an adequate education
even more difficult, and thus greatly decreasing the life choices these
children would have available to them. In order to alleviate this challenge, I
began a rabbit project at the primary school. Me and a friend raised funds and
were able to buy building supplies and hire a builder to construct hutches,
then bought rabbits. Our hopes are this project will not only provide adequate
funding to the school by selling rabbits as a food source, but to also provide
children with a hands-on experience in animal care and developing important
business skills.
