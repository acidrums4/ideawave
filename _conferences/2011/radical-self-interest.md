To be successful in any field, you must be selfish. Olympians, businesspeople
and stay-at-home moms are all selfish. However, the top of any field, embraces
a deeper, less discussed ideal of selfishness. The most successful embrace an
ethic of radical self interest. Radical self interest, as Olympic gold
medalist Adam Kreek defines it, is caring so much about yourself and your
immediate family that you give whole-heartedly to the environment and your
community. You want clean air, water and land to support your health; you want
a strong community to support your ambitions; you want a workplace that is as
radically self-interested as you are.

From an engineering background, Adam lives the ideal of radical self interest.
He has built an appleseed biodiesel reactor from scratch and is a member of
his local biodiesel co-op. Adam also lives at Dockside Green in Victoria, BC,
a master planned community that was just awarded LEED platinum certification
for its forward thinking ethos: People, Planet, Profit. Radical self interest
delivers poignant truth: Adam would not have won a gold medal had he not
embraced an ethic of radical self interest. Adam found out first hand that
low-level selfish achievement is empty.

<!--about-->

Adam Kreek is a loving husband and proud father who lives part-time in two
cities: Victoria, BC, and Ottawa, ON.

An Olympic gold medalist in Beijing 2008, he is writing a book due out
this fall with a working title, Confessions of an Olympian. Adam explores
the secrets of great achievement through the lens of his Olympic journey,
in a sport that is often described as the most physically demanding,
and most reliant upon teamwork: rowing in an eight-man shell. Adam has
retired from international competition, but keeps close ties to the
Olympic movement. He sits on the Canadian Olympic Committee board of
directors and is the vice-chair of the athletes commission.

Although retired, Adam still rows. He regularly fishes for crabs in his
sliding-seat whitehall spirit dory. Also, in December of this year he will row
across the Atlantic ocean from Liberia to Venezuela, supporting Right to Play
and making another documentary.
