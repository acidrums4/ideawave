To be successful in any field, you must be selfish. Olympians, businesspeople
and stay-at-home moms are all selfish. However, the top of any field, embraces
a deeper, less discussed ideal of selfishness. The most successful embrace an
ethic of radical self interest. Radical self interest, as Olympic gold
medalist Adam Kreek defines it, is caring so much about yourself and your
immediate family that you give whole-heartedly to the environment and your
community. You want clean air, water and land to support your health; you want
a strong community to support your ambitions; you want a workplace that is as
radically self-interested as you are.

From an engineering background, Adam lives the ideal of radical self interest.
He has built an appleseed biodiesel reactor from scratch and is a member of
his local biodiesel co-op. Adam also lives at Dockside Green in Victoria, BC,
a master planned community that was just awarded LEED platinum certification
for its forward thinking ethos: People, Planet, Profit. Radical self interest
delivers poignant truth: Adam would not have won a gold medal had he not
embraced an ethic of radical self interest. Adam found out first hand that
low-level selfish achievement is empty.
