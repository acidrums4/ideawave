Embedded journalism has been utilized in foreign countries during times of
war, but its greatest potential is within our own borders and the best way to
achieve this is through regulation. We can increase government transparency by
creating laws designed to protect embedded journalists. These laws would
enable journalists to embed on domestic and foreign assignments within most
areas of the Canadian government.

This would enable a kind of “deep reporting” about our everyday government
institutions: hospitals, safety inspection agencies, prisons and fire
departments, to name but a few. The regulation of embedded journalism is a
powerful legal idea that would strengthen Canadian democracy.
