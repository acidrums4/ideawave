Corporations, governments and other large organizations function share several
typical “features”:  
1\. Power is concentrated at the top (Lord Ashton recognized this problem:
“Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely”)  
2\. The people impacted by the decisions rarely have input nor buy-in to these
decisions (this violates human rights, the concept of democracy and minimizes
accountability)  
3\. The decisions serve the organizations’ own interests, as opposed to being
broad based and sustainable (this ignores the interconnectedness of all
things, and the responsibility we have toward society)  
4\. The decision making is polarized, has unintended consequences, and does
not achieve the intended result (it speaks to the failure of organizations to
capture the full variety of aspects and issues that must be understood and
contended with. Ignoring these for the sake of simplicity is simple minded)

My idea: We inherited the bureaucratic structure of our organizations from an
era where most people were illiterate serfs. Today we have a completely
inverse model where people are literate, we have the Internet, and we have the
interest and capability to manage our own destiny. The opportunity is to
reinvent how we collaborate as members of organizations and of society to
govern more effectively.

**Jean-Daniel Cusin** has over 25 years of business management experience
working with organizations in virtually every sector of activity from mining
to pharmaceuticals, food preparation to software development, service
organizations and non-profits to heavy manufacturing. His areas of focus
includes operational improvement, business process and operational
optimization as well as structural and leadership alignment.

Today, he is specialized in effective organizational processes, structures and
governance. He recently launched a new venture called e-Deliberation that
supports organizations and groups with the deliberation and resolution of
“wicked” problems – problems that are multi-dimensional and that impact a lot
of stakeholders. Mr. Cusin feels that most the problems we face as a society
are “wicked” in that they are apparently intractable, complex and impact a lot
of people. Hence his interest, and motivation to do something about it.

Mr. Cusin was born in Switzerland, is a Canadian citizen and lives on the
Island. He obtained his M.A. in Leadership and Training from Royal Roads
University.
