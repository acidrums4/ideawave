As technology has progressed, so has the application of technology in the
conduct of crime. At the same time, our school systems have, in many cases,
failed to provide even basic information about the application of security and
privacy to day to day computing activities. Similarly, many universities lack
any form of computer security curriculum even in computer science departments.
The rapid pace of technological change is outpacing the ability of our
educational institutions to build these necessary skills because of a lack of
specialization around security, privacy and family safety because they,
necessarily, focus on classroom management, basic skills and specific teaching
goals. There is a solution for this. There is a very active community of
computer security specialists and researchers. As a community we can raise the
bar by engaging with schools and community centers and applying our expertise
in an informal setting. With the right engagement, we can help the next
generation avoid the sins of the past (and present) and create a more
insightful mindset with regard to online safety.

**Jeff Williams** has served in multiple executive roles in security and
privacy, has taught risk management at the masters level, has a great sense of
both humor and pragmatism and understands how children think about the
internet and why, without guidance, it will break the future.
