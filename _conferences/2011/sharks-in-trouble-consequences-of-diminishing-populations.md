There's something glamorous about the idea of a dark-eyed monster rising from the deep to rip us to shreds, but the reality is: a shark's diet has never included humans. The simple fact that a human being is scared to even come close to the water's edge for fear of being eaten by sharks brings to light a deep-rooted terror that has been instilled in man from centuries of myths, folklore, and accidental attacks. So little is known about these species simply because no one is willing to get to know them. Sharks are a vital part of our earth. They play a pivotal role in the ocean and contribute immensely to the way we live our lives. Every second we spend despising instead of helping them, we not only condemn the world's ecosystems to irreparable damage, we sentence ourselves and our future generations to depleted resources and an overall lesser quality of life.
