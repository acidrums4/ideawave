We have developed and tested a school power system meant for developing
countries. A working model was built in a house in Esquimalt and has been
tested for about one year.

Using solar panels for power, nickel iron batteries for storage and leading
edge DC LED lights the system has an expected lifespan of about 30 years
without battery replacement.

The concept is to buld an Edison style power system that is low voltage DC
throughout. Since it is all low voltage it is impossible for anyone to be
electrocuted while working on the system and doing maintenance. Going totally
DC gives maximum efficiency for such a system and Nickel Iron batteries do not
expose developing countries to the pollution that lead acid batteries would
cause. It is both environmentally friendly and safer than anything currently
available.

The hardware design will be open source and available to the UN or other
groups offinger aid to developing countries.

Ian Soutar will be presenting. Ian has worked at the NRC in Ottawa in the
early 1980s. In 1986 he formed Microsec R&D Inc. to develop electronic
products. After many years of contracting Microsec is changing the focus to
include renewable energy systems.

Ian has patents on a number of devices ranging from medical and industrial
tools, games, agricultural tools and communication systems. He specializes
also in radio communication.
