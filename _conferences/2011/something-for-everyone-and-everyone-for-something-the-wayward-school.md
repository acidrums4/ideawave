The Wayward School is an upcoming series of co-operatively facilitated skill
and knowledge-sharing events and gatherings in various venues throughout the
GVR.

Lecturers and instructors are people who have a skill or idea that they are
excited to share with others. They might be professionals in their field or
hobbyists with a little-known passion. They could also be relatively new to
the subject they teach, but can research it further and try it on for size in
a group setting. Teachers teach in exchange for a complimentary membership
(which gets them a discount on all other workshops), and the opportunity to
flex their teaching muscles without needing a doctorate or other lofty
credentials.

Because the school is user-driven, content will change based on what people
can and want to offer, or what they seek to learn from others. An overarching
theme will guide content within 2-3 month seasons, e.g. “Home Economics” or
“The Cosmos”. Multidisciplinary skillshares, academic lectures, swap meets,
film nights, podcasts and public debates will create a kind of “festival of
learning” that contributes to civic literacy and community engagement by
giving people room to think and a chance to act.
