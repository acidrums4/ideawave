I would like to build a small scale wind farm consisting of around 4 wind
turbines. I have data on Vancouver Island for a specific location and as of
current analysis the site good for wind potential. One turbine would be
allocated for my personal revenue, while the other 3 would be used for funding
various environmental conservation organizations, special projects, causes or
businesses oriented towards sustainability, and/or research in green
technologies and practices. Based on general estimates of a site with good
wind potential, each turbine could generate 350-450 thousand dollars per year
(2 MW turbine). For the 10-13 years that it would take to pay off the project,
~50 thousand dollars would be taken from each turbine to fund the green
initiatives (150 thousand) and provide an income for myself (50 thousand).

When the project is paid off, the full amount generated by each turbine
would then be used. This leads to a significant amount of capitol that
would be generated. It could be set up as a trust/foundation or given
away entirely each year.
