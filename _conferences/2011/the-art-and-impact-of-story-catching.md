The art of story catching is both old and new.This session will talk about
what makes it work, both the technology and interpersonal elements, the high
tech and high touch aspects.

There’s hard science behind why storytelling is so important. In research on
the brain, scientists have found that hearing a story rather than simply
reading text fires up a richer set of connectors, it sparks emotions, it
summons up connections with memories, and so you remember things when they’re
in a storytelling format two to seven times more than you do than if you just
get the text alone. Video Story Catching allows individuals and organizations
to take their story to the next step. We will look at the art, and spirit, the
pathway and the destination, that will give greater likelihood that others
will pay attention. That your story will engage, and open doors.
