The Digital Divide is very real, and when the gap is bridged the results can
be surprising, creative, instructive, even inspiring. By focusing on case
studies of social media use among homeless individuals (taken from my personal
teaching practice) this talk will provide radical new strategies for more
informed and effective communications for anyone.

**Lorraine “raincoaster” Murphy** is the President of Social Media Club of
Vancouver and has been a professional blogger and social media trainer since
2002. She specializes in teaching beginners and those with barriers to
internet use, and in social media for social change.

Her flagship blog,
[raincoaster.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413203309/http://raincoaster.com/),
has been studied as part of the New Media curriculum in three universities,
and the comments thread on her Mummified Fairy post has been called “one of
the most beautiful things on the internet.” She once got into a flamewar with
the nation of Albania, and won. She conducts workshops in the transformative
use of social media on Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, and blogs regularly to
seven different sites.
