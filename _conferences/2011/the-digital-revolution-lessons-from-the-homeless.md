The Digital Divide is very real, and when the gap is bridged the results can
be surprising, creative, instructive, even inspiring. By focusing on case
studies of social media use among homeless individuals (taken from my personal
teaching practice) this talk will provide radical new strategies for more
informed and effective communications for anyone.
