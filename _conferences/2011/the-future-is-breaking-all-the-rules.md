I’m one of those people who follows all the rules. As a child, I would feel
guilty for even being ACCUSED of stealing a cookie. Laws are there to protect
citizens. Codes of conduct keep us in line. There are rules and regulations in
place so that society functions properly, and if we follow those rules and
regulations, society WILL function properly. Right?

Right?

I’m one of those people who bends the rules. Rules aren’t hard and fast.
They’re guidelines. They’re suggestions of how to behave, how society should
function. When it comes down to it, many of the best things in my life have
come from organizations being flexible – from choosing classes in high school
and university, to gaining an internship at the world’s biggest comedy
festival. What are we missing out on by having so many rules? And what would
happen if we became more flexible?

I am in my first year in Camosun College’s Applied Communication Program,
where I am improving my skills in video, radio, desktop and web publishing,
journalistic writing, and photography. Last year I spent 6 months in
Australia, where I fell madly in love with Melbourne. This summer I am headed
to Montreal to be a digital marketing intern at the Just for Laughs comedy
festival, an internship that I got without sending a cover letter or resume!
