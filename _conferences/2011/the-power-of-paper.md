> With the advent of technology and the seeming demise of analog as a primary
form of communication, I’m of the belief that paper is still the most
effective and powerful tool one can have at their disposal when it comes to
creation and organization.

> My talk will break down the benefits of sticking with paper over digital
devices, in terms of both physical and visceral permanence. There’s something
about writing things down that allows them to sink in and fuse with our
psyches that much better.

> I will include audience participation in this talk, where the power of paper
will be demonstrated.
