Many years ago in grade school I was asked by an amazing teacher to
interview my grandma. The results of my interview weren’t very in
depth, lacked uniqueness and at the bottom of my page in scolding red
ink the teacher wrote, “Your grandma has experienced much more than
she is letting on, dig deeper. She has more to say.”

That experience only recently resurfaced when my grandmother’s
dementia escalated and she had no recollection of her past.  All of her
experiences, and the wisdom she had built up were now erased. This, I
realized is an all too common problem. As a community we forget that time
is limited and the transfer of knowledge is essential to understanding
each other.

There had to be a way for me to capture this time sensitive knowledge. I
wanted to connect analog citizens to a new digital generation.  I created
the Grow Wisdom project.

This is about all of us digging deeper.
