The [Victoria City Wide WiFi
Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20210307001955/http://openwifi.ca/) is
working to create open, free-to-use wireless connectivity through out the
Greater Victoria Area creating a [wireless mesh
network](https://web.archive.org/web/20210307001955/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network)
embeded in the community. A wireless mesh network is a self healing, self
growing form of computer networking made up of wireless access devices.

We are working with local business and government to create, launch, and
operate the network.

Free WiFi for the city of Victoria would be great, but being able to affect
social change through the network would be even greater. With the mesh network
in place services for the community can be built on top of it. Things like
WiFi VoIP phones for low income earning house. Phone that have no street value
for resale and only work in Victoria but are essentially a cellphone to stay
in touch with Family, Work, and Social Assistance. Things like inexpensive
merchant services for open air markets.

The internet is supposed to be freedom, and free access to information. An
open, free to use public network could provide basic access to internet and
the web to even the playing field through access to information and services
online.

My name is **Liam McLachlan**. I do IT support services in the greater
Victoria area. I have a passion for technologies that enable people, and that
create value beyond the basic application of that technology.
