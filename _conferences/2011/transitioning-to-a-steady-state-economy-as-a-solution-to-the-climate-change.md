Climate change remains the defining issue of the 21st Century. All world
leaders have agreed that we must keep Greenhouse Gas emissions to less than
450 parts per million and the global temperature rise to less than 2Â°
Centigrade above the historic average.

The premise of this talk is that focusing on ecological strategies to solve
climate change leads to the setting of meaningless targets and support for
ineffective policies like cap and trade. The biggest impediment to acting on
the climate crisis is rigid adherence to the neoclassical, growth and
consumption based economic model which virtually all governments across the
planet support.

Economic reform is the path to dealing with climate change. We must transition
to a model that creates economic prosperity by living within our ecological
means. The model is called a Steady State Economy. In a Steady State Economy,
prosperity is achieved by re-localizing everything and creating self-
sufficient, resilient sustainable regions. It is an economy that closes the
gap between rich and poor and it results in communities where all can afford a
decent standard of living and where they have access to meaningful work
through jobs created locally in the business, government and the not-for-
profit sectors.
