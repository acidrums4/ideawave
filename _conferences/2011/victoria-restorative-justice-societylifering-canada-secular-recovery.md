Restorative justice is a community-based approach to addressing crime that
focuses on repairing harm and relationships, restoring balance and
reintegrating victims and offenders back into the community. This is achieved
by actualizing restorative principles such as: working towards the restitution
of victims, empowering them and responding to their needs as they see them;
supporting offenders, while encouraging them to understand, accept and carry
out their obligations; recognizing that obligations should not be intended as
harms, and must be achievable; providing opportunities for dialogue between
victim and offender as appropriate; finding meaningful ways to involve the
community; and encouraging collaboration and reintegration rather than
coercion and isolation.

What would happen if these principals and foundations were used in addressing
the harms that have resulted for addiction? When in active addiction, a person
can inflict devastating harm on their families and within their communities.
When in recovery, how can the “offender” repair these harms in a meaningful
way? Can Circles, a restorative process, be used for “making amends?” If so,
what would that look like? Can the worlds of recovery and restorative justice
come together to create a new avenue to repair harm in the aftermath of
addiction?
