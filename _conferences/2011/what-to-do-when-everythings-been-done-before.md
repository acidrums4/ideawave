Internet not only killed television, but it also killed art as it was once
seen in history.

In ten minutes I wish to allow for a brief understanding of art’s uses in
history and how art is becoming more and more useless through the sharing of
information over the internet. One can now glimpse at art history through a
video easily accessable over the internet, and no longer does art play the
same role it once did in the sharing of information and knowledge to a large
mass of people.

So how does art adapt to this new society that acts like a child with ADHD and
no medication? By growing past the idea that “everything’s been done before.”
