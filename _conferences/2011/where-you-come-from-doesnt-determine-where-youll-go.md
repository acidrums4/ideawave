I would like to present a talk about using the tools individuals are given
from their experiences in life to their benefit, and refusing to let where
they have come from limit their dreams and aspirations about what they would
like to do with their lives. All too often people like you and me, make
assumptions about what we are capable of achieving and where we are capable of
taking ourselves based off of factors such as, socio-economic status, what our
parent(s)/guardians do for a living and what they gave us in terms of life
skills, and how intelligent, driven, or capable of success we are, because of
these different aspects of our background, or where we “came from”.

In my talk I would like to use my own personal story, and other well-known
success stories as examples of how life experiences and ascribed social
positions don’t cause restrictions in an individuals abilities to dream big
and achieve their goals, and how individuals can in fact use the survival
skills these experiences have equipped them with to their advantage to get
where they want to go.

My name is **Briana Vojnovich**. I am a third-year undergraduate student at
the University of Victoria, in the Social Sciences Faculty. I am working
towards completing a major in Sociology and a minor in Business. While in
school, I work part-time at the Keg on Quadra St. and I am a member of the
University of Victoria chapter of Young Women in Business. I was a Miss
Nanaimo Ambassador from April 2007 to late-September, 2008, and because of
this I have had thorough practice in public speaking through the Toast Masters
program. I have a performance background as a dancer, singer, and actor, which
also contributes to my comfort in front of large audiences.
