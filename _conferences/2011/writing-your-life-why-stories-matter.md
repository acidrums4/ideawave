We are the only species in the world who defines itself through the telling of
stories, in words and music, through art and dance. Our lives are a journey
that can be thought of as a story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end.
Stories can show us who we are, as well as illuminate the secret hearts of
others, and in doing so, can bring us closer to each other. In viewing our
lives as a narrative, we take control of the story, and pick up the pen to our
destiny. Not everything can be changed. But our reactions to the things that
can’t, and where we situate ourselves in relation to them, is a choice. I will
introduce ten simple thoughts, almost like mantras, to illustrate my point.
They will serve to show how stories can matter when we are trying to make
sense of our lives.
