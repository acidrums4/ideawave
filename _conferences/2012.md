# 2012 Conference

On February 25 and 26th, 2012, hundreds of critical thinkers, from inventors to philanthropists, will come together in Victoria, British Columbia for the third time to share their thoughts and engage each other in dialogue about ideas and their place in the world.

IdeaWave is a forum where critical thinkers are able to mix and mingle in a highly engaging environment.

Each day of the conference starts at 9am (registration starts at 8:30am on the 25th!) and consists of a series of  ten minutes talks with frequent discussion breaks. Talks are designed to be a snapshot of the speaker’s idea and to open the door for discussion about the talk. There is no limit on subject matter and topics will range from business to cultural to lifestyle ideas. It will once again be hosted at the [Ambrosia catering and event centre](http://www.ambrosiacatering.ca/ambrosia_conference_centre_contact.shtml)!

We will be posting talks to this page as they’re accepted, so check back regularly. Submit your idea!

Tickets are sold on a tier based system, the earlier you purchase your ticket for the week-end, the lower the price, so don’t delay. Register now!
