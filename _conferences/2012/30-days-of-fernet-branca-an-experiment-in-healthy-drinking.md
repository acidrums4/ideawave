For 30 days during January 2012, Janice decided to subject herself to a dose
of Fernet Branca every day to see if there might be any health benefits.  

Fernet Branca was originally created in 1845, as a digestif and health remedy.

Over drinks one evening, Janice jokingly speculated that herbal-based drinks
such as Fernet Branca might have beneficial properties. In fact, as she began
to look more closely at some of the ingredients, she found they were, in fact
powerful medicinals &#8230; thus she embarked on a commitment to try Fernet Branca
for 30 Days.  

She will highlight some of the changes she observed during that month, and
share some of the other surprising things she discovered about this elixer!
