Cities used to be social places designed for people. Now they are designed for
cars and commerce. Even in urban oasis like Vancouver the discussion centers
on such things as building heights, bike lanes and bus routes --- in other words
infrastructure issues. People have been left out of the equation.

My goal is to bring people back in to the discussion and promote a people
centred urbanism. If we feel that we are separate from our city, we will
continue to be ‘victims’ of all the things that aren’t working, instead of
becoming a part of the solution. We need to stop waiting for someone else
start the initiatives that we want to see. If we truly desire not just
livable, but lovable, communities we need to become “co-creators” of the type
of cities we want to live in.

Once we consider ourselves a community, and stewards of not only one another’s
well being, but also the well being of our city, anything is possible. By
retaking control of our cities and making our own changes—no matter how
small—we can take back our cities from the machines and machinations and
return to people centred cities.
