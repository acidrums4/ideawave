Come behind the scenes of the early days of Windowfarms as “Superforest”
Jackson works briefly with the project, suggests and demonstrates a novel
solution and saves the entire project from an expensive crisis. Skip forward a
couple of years, the Windowfarms project (hydroponic vegetable growing in your
windows) is a worldwide success in open source co-operation and Jackson is
unaware that he is a hero of the windowfarm movement and mentioned in 2 TED
Talks! (I know because I told him). How can we keep brilliant quirky citizen
scientists like Jackson interested and working to improve our lives? Let’s
find more Jacksons, and nurture them to help us all grow! I will show a few
pictures of windowfarm vegetables which are mindblowing and economically
disruptive. Also a few pics of neat innovations which came from the worldwide
community. I will dip into the “bee walls” projects that originated in central
Europe. Pollinators worldwide have suffered catastrophic decline and these
produce habitat for pollinators. I will also delve into citizen science solar
cooking research and compare the unique problems and opportunities that face
citizen scientists with those that face “real” scientists.
