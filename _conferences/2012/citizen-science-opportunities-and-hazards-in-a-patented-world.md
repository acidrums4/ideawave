Come behind the scenes of the early days of Windowfarms as “Superforest”
Jackson works briefly with the project, suggests and demonstrates a novel
solution and saves the entire project from an expensive crisis. Skip forward a
couple of years, the Windowfarms project (hydroponic vegetable growing in your
windows) is a worldwide success in open source co-operation and Jackson is
unaware that he is a hero of the windowfarm movement and mentioned in 2 TED
Talks! (I know because I told him). How can we keep brilliant quirky citizen
scientists like Jackson interested and working to improve our lives? Let’s
find more Jacksons, and nurture them to help us all grow! I will show a few
pictures of windowfarm vegetables which are mindblowing and economically
disruptive. Also a few pics of neat innovations which came from the worldwide
community. I will dip into the “bee walls” projects that originated in central
Europe. Pollinators worldwide have suffered catastrophic decline and these
produce habitat for pollinators. I will also delve into citizen science solar
cooking research and compare the unique problems and opportunities that face
citizen scientists with those that face “real” scientists.

Bio: Brian White a citizen scientist too!  
My “pulser pump” went on Wikipedia last year, and my video about it is the
most watched “airlift pump” related video on the internet. According to
youtube, it is seen in more than 150 countries every month.  
I am also involved in the linen project. (Growing flax for food and fibre),
making habitat for solitary bees, and I made a “2 storey compost bin” that is
in an e-book from instructables. I have also made several solar cooker
innovations.  
I have never succeeded in getting funding for the projects, (which slows
things down a lot).  
On the plus side, I have never been curbed by the strings attached to funding,
which can stop things altogether!
