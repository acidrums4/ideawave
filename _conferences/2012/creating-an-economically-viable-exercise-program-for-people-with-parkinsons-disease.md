Parkinson’s disease(PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that effects
voluntary movement control. There are approximately 100,000 people in Canada
with PD and 11,000 in British Columbia.  

Exercise has been shown to be effective at improving the motor and non-motor
symptoms of PD. A recently developed novel Parkinson’s disease (PD) exercise
intervention called LVST® BIG uses repetitive, large amplitude movement to
improve both movement perception and amplitude, enhancing balance and
functional mobility. However this program is delivered in one: one sessions 4
x/week for 4 weeks and therefore is not economically viable to deliver within
the current healthcare climate.  

This study investigates whether a group delivery model offered 2 x/week for 8
weeks can confer the same positive benefits as the individual treatment.  

The benefit of delivering the exercise program in a group format is that costs
are significantly reduced, making this program economically viable to be
delivered in hospital and community programs. This exercise program could be a
feasible option for an ongoing community based exercise program. Research has
shown that continued exercise results in better health outcomes for people
with Parkinson’s Disease and could create saving to the Canadian Healthcare
system.
