CSA (Community-Supported Agriculture) is perhaps the acronym for our time.
Many of us nowadays are questioning the effects of a global market economy on
our lives and looking for smaller-scale, community-based alternatives. We’re
confused about where our food comes from and eager to eat better. CSA’s might
just be the answer. Much more than a weekly veg box, CSAs are really a type of
microinvestment, with the interest and capital returned in edible form. A CSA
subscription shares risks between growers and eaters and brings them together
in a direct and meaningful way. It is a simple, self-financing way for young
farmers and many other food producers to create meaningful work in a time of
high unemployment; and it helps consumers to take a closer look at where their
food comes from.
