This would be an introduction to diamagnetics as a natural occurring elements
that tend to move away from any magnetic field. Some of these elements include
water, gold silver copper bismuth, and wood. One man made materiel is
paralytic graphite and it has been used to demonstrate levitation over super
magnets. Another is fluorite which is florescent in the presence of long wave
UV. This may explain why some people can douse for water by being attuned to
the diamagnetic field. Through a comparison of uranium glass and fluorite a
new doped material possibly could be developed to produce strong diamagnetic
moments under the influence of intense photo energy resulting in linear drive
in micro-gravity.
