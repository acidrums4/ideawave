To many of us engaged in social media itâ€™s a no brainer that community
building is taking place. However, within academic circles the depth of this
community building is just beginning to be understood. There are various
social movements taking place online and this short talk will speak to how
feminists, women of color (racialized women) are connecting on line and
building community.

I argue that we are witnessing a reconfiguration of some of the old social
movement models on line, as feminists are building community online.
