On Vancouver Island:

* We have become dependent on imported food&#8230;
* We have only 72 hours of food supply --- in our supermarkets and restaurants&#8230;
* 98% of us source our food in supermarkets and restauarants
* We need more people growing and producing health-friendly food _in_ a community _for_ a community&#8230;
* There are approx’ 75,000 school-age students (500,000 in BC) who are able and capable of growing and producing food --- on a substantial scale
* The “Growing Young Farmers” ‘School Program’ actually teaches --- mainly in a hands-on manner --- school-age students how to grow and produce health-friendly food&#8230;
* Designated classes --- _every week_ --- particpate in the Program&#8230;
* The Program becomes part and parcel of the students school week --- every week&#8230;
* The Program is structured, supervised and mentored and, with the support of the respective teaching staff, is run by experienced ‘Grower-Educators’
* The ‘aim and objective’ of the Program is for it to become --- in the not too distant future --- part of the official school-based curriculum
