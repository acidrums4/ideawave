> The [hackerspace](http://hackerspaces.org/) phenomenon is well
established, but biohackerspaces are just getting off the ground. From
sequencing to synthesis, the tools of modern molecular biology are close
at hand. In this talk I intend to share some of the work Iâ€™ve been
involved in at BioCurious in the SF bay area, and how I intend to bring
that home to Victoria. Identify plants and bacteria, sample your genome,
create glowing bacteria (or anything else, really!)
