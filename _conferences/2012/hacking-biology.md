The
[hackerspace](https://web.archive.org/web/20210307003520/http://hackerspaces.org/)
phenomenon is well established, but biohackerspaces are just getting off the
ground. From sequencing to synthesis, the tools of modern molecular biology
are close at hand. In this talk I intend to share some of the work Iâ€™ve been
involved in at BioCurious in the SF bay area, and how I intend to bring that
home to Victoria. Identify plants and bacteria, sample your genome, create
glowing bacteria (or anything else, really!)

Derek Jacoby is a PhD student at UVic, founding member of
[makerspace.ca](https://web.archive.org/web/20210307003520/http://makerspace.ca/),
fellow at BioCurious, biotech faculty at Singularity University. Scientist,
maker, developer, designer, prognosticator, tag-cloud bio author.
