Think of the multitude of possessions that sit, unused in your garages, on
shelves, in storage containers. Now, think of how much “stuff” your friends
are also sitting on. The world is filled with other people’s possessions just
waiting to be used again! Free the world’s possessions with Lenderizer, the
first social marketplace. Lenderizer helps you share and connect with your
friends.

Bio: Reed Botwright is a technoholic who is hooked on new ideas. I love
connecting with people and learning new things. I have a background in
software engineering, customer support and business development. My goal is to
build an idea that changes the world!
