Out with the YES-man, in with the AND-man!

Improviser and storyteller Dave Morris teaches you how to collaborate better
by not just saying yes, but by saying AND! Saying yes allows other people to
get work done, but by saying AND you actually help them do it. In this talk
youâ€™ll learn how to get your ego out of the way and let your ideas reach their
full potential.
