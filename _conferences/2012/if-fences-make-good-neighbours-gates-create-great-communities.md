> I live on a little semi-rural/semi-suburban street and farm on a teeny, tiny
farm less than 2 acres in size. Sustainable farming on such a small piece of
land is very difficult, but put in some gates, team up with the neighbours,
and thatâ€™s a whole other story. Working with the neighbours on six different
properties to create a friendly, cooperative venture means we are putting
nearly 25 acres of arable land back into production, growing market garden
crops and organic fruit, raising pigs, and using goats to do everything from
clear brambles, produce fibre, milk, and soap, and work as draft animals.

> Ducks, chickens, and ponies round out the collection of farm animals and crops
include garlic, kiwi, cherries, apples, and all manner of veggies and herbs.

> Plans are in the works for a local, pony-powered delivery system and the
operation of a farm-stand staffed by various members of the new farm
community. With energy, enthusiasm, and a vision of producing local, healthy,
organic food, this group of neighbours is teaming up to create a new
(certainly new to our neighbourhood!) way of living together in a community.

> This talk will describe the process of using a collective strategy to band
together to maximize the use of even small plots of land in order to produce
food. Given that Vancouver Island stores and restaurants have only a 72-hour
supply of food on hand and that we now rely on off-island suppliers for more
than 95% of all that we eat, it only makes sense that we work together to
produce more, healthy food within our own communities.
