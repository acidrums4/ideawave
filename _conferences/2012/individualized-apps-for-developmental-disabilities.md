Though we label people with developmental disabilities as “cognitively
disabled” or “intellectually disabled,” we do not really know much of the time
whether it is their ability to think that is impaired, or just their ability
to communicate their thoughts, or take in communication from others. Examples
of impaired communication that could be interpreted as impaired thought are
easy to come up with — people with stroke, for example, or Stephen Hawking and
ALS. Recently, it has become apparent that mobile, touch-screen technology
like iPads is helping some people with developmental disabilities communicate
more effectively. And once they can communicate more effectively we discover
that they have more cognitive abilities than previously suspected. In this
talk I would like to raise the prospect of individualized apps for people with
developmental disabilities, aimed at eliminating the communication barriers
that may mask their real power to think, imagine, and create.
