*Radiation Hormesis*

Living things deal with millions of cosmic rays passing through them every
hour. Genetic errors occur every hour and are repaired immediately. The
mechanism for repair is now know by biologists. The concept of Radiation
Hormesis suggests that increasing the external background radiation improves
the functioning of the repair mechanism and protects the body from cancer. It
also improves immunity.

This concept is now supported by several thousand peer reviewed studies
worldwide. Strangely it was also supported by thousands of experiments between
1900 to 1940. However in 1959 the UN and other organizations stated that ALL
levels of nuclear radiation are harmful. This was during the cold war. People
have believed it ever since but without scientific backup. No doubt high
levels of radiation are harmful but low levels are often beneficial.

Low levels of external radiation are not to be confused with consumable
sources of radiation like iodine from nuclear accidents! This is truly bad
radiation. Can this concept be used for improving health? I am experimenting
with the wearing of uranium glass jewellery in order to increase the
background radiation levels and improve health. Uranium has been used to make
green and yellow glass since 1812. Antique depression glass is uranium
coloured.Uranium beads seem to be available at most bead stores &#8230; as long as
you bring a geiger counter to find them. The uranium is locked into the glass
and cannot accidentally be consumed. I have been experiencing beneficial
effects from making a point of exposing myself to low levels of radiation of a
safe type.
