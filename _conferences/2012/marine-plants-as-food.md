We shop the world for substances to nourish our bodies, but we are missing a
huge gift from nature on this island of ours.  
Agri-business has changed the nutrient value of fruits and vegetables. Pharma-
companies persuade us we must have vitamins and minerals in pill form. Protein
production is big business. Packaged foods do not nourish. Prevention is not
profitable and what is being advertised and offered to us as food may not be
our best choice.  
As alternatives, we look to organic, local, slow, sustainable, home-grown, but
have we considered marine plants?

Bio: Known as nannutrition, Nancy Laird has a background in Food Science and
holistic nutrition with experience in government, industry and academia.  
Currently associated with DBMP in Qualicum Beach, Nancy is investigating
marine plants local to Vancouver Island as a source of safe, sustainable,
secure, and nutritious food.  
She loves a good meal with friends.
