The latest research shows surprising plasticity in our brain functions.

Handedness in people relates to how our digits and limbs are ‘mapped’ into our
brains.

Musicians hands map differently than non-musicians. Mind Maps can ‘grow’ or be
altered via practice or injury.

This talk looks at how Mind Mapping works and includes exercises to illustrate
your current Mind Map.
