> I would like to discuss how we are on the verge of a new age of mindfulness
and how this has managed to happen. I believe that productivity systemization
and mindfulness are beginning to intersect to the point where we have gone
being simple to-do lists and are moving towards to-be lists. We are no longer
just interested in “doing” productive, we are striving to be productive --- and
in the things we really are passionate about. Technology, social media and the
Internet can work on either side of that equation — it can distract us or
attract us to what we really want out of life — and a new age of mindfulness
married with proper use of systems and technology is on the horizon.
