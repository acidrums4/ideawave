> I would like to discuss how we are on the verge of a new age of mindfulness
and how this has managed to happen. I believe that productivity systemization
and mindfulness are beginning to intersect to the point where we have gone
being simple to-do lists and are moving towards to-be lists. We are no longer
just interested in “doing” productive, we are striving to be productive --- and
in the things we really are passionate about. Technology, social media and the
Internet can work on either side of that equation — it can distract us or
attract us to what we really want out of life — and a new age of mindfulness
married with proper use of systems and technology is on the horizon.

<!--about-->

Mike Vardy is the writer, speaker, and “productivityist” behind Vardy.me
and the productivity parody site Eventualism. Vardy’s candid satire has made
him a desirable speaker on an often dry topic, delivering talks on the topic
such as “Hacking Lifehacks” at TEDx Juan De Fuca and presenting keynote talks
at events in Vancouver and Victoria. Currently a Managing Editor at Stepcase
Lifehack, Vardy has contributed to many popular productivity websites and
publications, including David Allen’s GTD Times and Productive Magazine and
has appeared in local publications (YAM Magazine, Black Press) and nationally
in The Globe and Mail. He lives with his wife, daughter and son in Victoria,
BC, Canada.
