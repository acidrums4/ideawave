> Last year, I spoke at IdeaWave about the psychology behind compassion
in terms of why we are drawn to help in Haiti. This year I bring
the results of that compassion: Moto Logistics, a new approach to
development in Haiti. My registered charity One Hundred For Haiti was
founded after the earthquake as a relief organization to benefit the
people of post-earthquake Haiti. Over the last two years we have delivered
tons of supplies to Haiti and helped medical clinics and orphanages via
financial support and delivery of supplies. For 2012, we are shifting
our focus based on the ideas I delivered in IdeaWave 2011, and are
launching Moto Logistics, a program that combines a desire to focus on
development rather than relief and thus empower people rather than have
them become increasingly dependent on aid. Moto Logistics will see us buy,
on no-interest loan, two motorcycles (dirt bikes) for one medical clinic
and one orphanage in a pilot program to see if our new idea for how these
motorcycles can be used for income generation and job creation will be
effective. Each organization will use the motorcycles by day to transport
supplies and patients, and by night as a private moto-taxi service. The
income raised from the moto-taxi service will be split between a repair
fund for the bikes, a portion to repayment of the loan, and the rest
as profit to the organization itself. Details about the program, the
concepts behind it, and why an approach of development rather than relief
is the most effective for Haiti will be discussed in the talk. I will
use first hand accounts of people I have met in Haiti on my seven trips
there and the needs and humanity they expressed to me. The talk will
provide a model for development that other social/humanitarian workers
can use in their own communities to create jobs and generate real change.

<!--about-->

Greg is the founder of One Hundred For Haiti and has been to Haiti seven
times since the earthquake. Immediately after the January 12th earthquake in
Haiti, Greg was on the crew of the Liberty Schooner, an all-volunteer mission
that sailed from Miami to the southern coast of Haiti to bring 10,000 pounds
of medical supplies and food to the people in most dire need. The Liberty and
its crew were the first independent relief boat to reach the southern coast of
Haiti from the United States and Greg received international press coverage of
the trip on the Peter Greenberg Worldwide radio program. He realized the need
for ongoing involvement and One Hundred For Haiti campaign responded to that
need, through ongoing support and development projects. Greg is also the co-
founder of The World Leaders Project, a multi-year initiative to discuss
issues related to the psychology of human violence face-to-face with world
leaders, an initiative that led to a meeting with the President of Guyana as
well as correspondence with other governments as well. He was the co-producer
of the multi-award winning documentaries “Flight From Death: The Quest for
Immortality” and “The Philosopher Kings”, two films which explore often unseen
sides of the human experience: our relationship with death and the effect that
this has on our psyche, and the quest for wisdom and with whom in our social
strata does that wisdom reside. He makes his living as a keynote speaker
worldwide.
