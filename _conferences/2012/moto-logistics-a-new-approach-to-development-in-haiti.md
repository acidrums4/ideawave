> Last year, I spoke at IdeaWave about the psychology behind compassion
in terms of why we are drawn to help in Haiti. This year I bring
the results of that compassion: Moto Logistics, a new approach to
development in Haiti. My registered charity One Hundred For Haiti was
founded after the earthquake as a relief organization to benefit the
people of post-earthquake Haiti. Over the last two years we have delivered
tons of supplies to Haiti and helped medical clinics and orphanages via
financial support and delivery of supplies. For 2012, we are shifting
our focus based on the ideas I delivered in IdeaWave 2011, and are
launching Moto Logistics, a program that combines a desire to focus on
development rather than relief and thus empower people rather than have
them become increasingly dependent on aid. Moto Logistics will see us buy,
on no-interest loan, two motorcycles (dirt bikes) for one medical clinic
and one orphanage in a pilot program to see if our new idea for how these
motorcycles can be used for income generation and job creation will be
effective. Each organization will use the motorcycles by day to transport
supplies and patients, and by night as a private moto-taxi service. The
income raised from the moto-taxi service will be split between a repair
fund for the bikes, a portion to repayment of the loan, and the rest
as profit to the organization itself. Details about the program, the
concepts behind it, and why an approach of development rather than relief
is the most effective for Haiti will be discussed in the talk. I will
use first hand accounts of people I have met in Haiti on my seven trips
there and the needs and humanity they expressed to me. The talk will
provide a model for development that other social/humanitarian workers
can use in their own communities to create jobs and generate real change.
