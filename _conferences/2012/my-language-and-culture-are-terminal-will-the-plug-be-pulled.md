> No culture is static and mine is not only terminal, but in palliative care.

> I am a member of a very small ethnic group and one of the youngest members to
grow up still speaking the language. As a group we were expelled from our home
in 1939. The generations born since the war are being assimilated into Germany
and Canada and only hold onto to fading memories of a 700 year history.

> Ever since I was young, I have spoken to my elders about our past. I now have
the front row seat for the death of a language and a culture.

> Will I have anyone interested in hearing about one more small obscure culture
that is terminal? Or is it time to pull the plug?

<!--about-->

Bernard von Schulmann is a 46 year old resident of Victoria of Baltic
German descent.

> I was born in Vancouver but I was sent off to school not being
able to speak any language other than Baltic German.

> I am also many other things, but they are not what this talk is about.
