Social media and the Occupy Movement: how has the nature of social media
influenced the direction Occupy has taken in the months since Zucotti Park
was first Occupied? What explains the different choices that different
Occupations have gravitated to? In a world with such diversity of choice
in communications, how do we avoid becoming a digital Tower of Babel,
or an archipelago of different platform loyalists?

What is the future of the Occupy movement online?
