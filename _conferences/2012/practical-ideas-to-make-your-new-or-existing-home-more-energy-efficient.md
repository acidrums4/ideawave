> One of the biggest contributions to our economical footprint are our homes.
They use a lot of energy for heating, lighting, hot water and much more.  

> I like to share some practical and cost efficient ways to make existing and
new homes more energy efficient. Some of these ideas are based on my own
experience, some are based on literature.  

> * Air tightness and insulation, how can you reduce “leakage” of energy from
your home?  
Heating systems:  
> * What can you do with an existing heating system to save energy?  
> * What’s the best heating system for new homes?  
> * Heating with wood: Does it make ecological and economical sense? Pro’s,
Con’s and practical experience  
> * Add renewable / alternative energy resources. What makes (financial) sense
on Vancouver Island? Solar Voltaic, Solar hot water, heat pumps, geothermal
heating systems?  
> * Energy efficient appliances --- which ones to replace first? Washer, dryer,
stove, fridge, freezer, TV???  
> * Lighting: Should we really all switch to CFL’s? What are the disadvantages,
what are better alternatives?  
> * Home automation systems: Expensive gadget for geeks and millionaires, or can
it be a practical tool to increase safety and reduce energy usage?

> (I will reduce this list and just pick the most interesting points)
