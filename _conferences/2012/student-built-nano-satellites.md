> The ECOSat team is Uvicâ€™s entry into the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge,
a challenge to 12 universities in Canada to design and build a 4kg, 3 litre
satellite. With decreasing prices in technology and a wide availability of
resources, students such as ourselves can build a working, space qualified
satellite that can accomplish much of the functionality of a full sized
satellite.

> This exciting challenge is a prime example of miniaturization of technology
and quickly became the highlight of our undergraduate careers.
