This talk consist of the world of high school politics, primarily on the level
of groups such as Student Councils and the fallacy it creates by giving
students the illusion of power in the schoolâ€™s structure.

This talk will discuss the concept of elections, finances, powers and role of
a Student Council inside a school and the changes that could be made to the
Student Council system to improve upon it.
