Mind Mapping is an excellent way of dealing with data. Currently we can use
computer programs to make them, or draw them out. Complex types of data can be
represented in 3D Mind Maps using various data structures. I know&#8230; It’s the
virtual world we were all dreaming about back in 80s and 90s. This time we can
actually make it work: a global web that can be archived, connected, queried,
rendered to various forms, organized, and connected to existing data sources,
multimedia, and access controlled. This system may be the ultimate p2p app
before we start using direct connections to the brain. Ultimately, This could
take care of the various points of failure in the Internet, and keep malicious
regimes at bay.
