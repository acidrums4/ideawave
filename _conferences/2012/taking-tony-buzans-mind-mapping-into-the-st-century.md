Mind Mapping is an excellent way of dealing with data. Currently we can use
computer programs to make them, or draw them out. Complex types of data can be
represented in 3D Mind Maps using various data structures. I know… It’s the
virtual world we were all dreaming about back in 80s and 90s. This time we can
actually make it work: a global web that can be archived, connected, queried,
rendered to various forms, organized, and connected to existing data sources,
multimedia, and access controlled. This system may be the ultimate p2p app
before we start using direct connections to the brain. Ultimately, This could
take care of the various points of failure in the Internet, and keep malicious
regimes at bay.

Bio: Joshua Caldwell, born February 6, 1978 in Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii. The first
computer I used was a Commodore PET with 8 or 4k of memory.

I learned very little from Computer Science 12, which I took in Grade 10, as
did many people in that class. We pursued our own projects. I got involved
with BBS stuff and in 1995 had a Linux BBS set up (there was only one other
Linux BBS in the lower mainland, not counting ISPs.)

I took a lot of English, literature, and creative writing courses, as well as
many history courses.

I ran a small ISP business with two of my friends for a while.

When I got to university, I had fun the first year, but hit the “sophomore
slump” and lost direction.

In 2009 I decided the leave the educational system, considering how many
victims the whole system produced. During have my career as a student, I never
stopped reading blogs. In fact, I was reading blogs before they were even
called that.

So far, I have had some commercial success providing high level support,
systems analysis, and some programming. I started training again about 3 weeks
ago after a 3 month bout with pneumonia. Aside from basic conditioning, I’ll
most likely be taking karate again.

I have a lot of crazy ideas that with a little money or time could be very
interesting. We’ll see what 2012 brings.
