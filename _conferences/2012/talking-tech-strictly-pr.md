This discussion centers on being outstanding, natural, and honest in sales
settings. For individuals who struggle with meeting the right people or
knowing the right moment to strike at an opportunity Ryan Levis will teach
vocal and postural technique-2-habits that can transform any person into a
more comfortable salesperson and speaker.  
We know that to succeed well in a physical action, such a presenting or
socializing, repetition is a good idea. What is more important though is to
understand how in fact our person is being perceived. Ryan Levis will talk
about being honest and offer insight into how one can aid external
perceptions. If you struggle talking in public or dislike being recorded, Ryan
Levis will leave you with a couple of easy mantras and an improved personal
brand. If you feel confident this talk will introduce you to even more fun
kinds of awkward.  
A blind participant will be pre-recorded for the event and that tape will show
how bodies physically lie in poor habitual postures. These can be more easily
improved with awareness. This is excellent demonstration for health and
wellness. Also it benefits attendee’s ability to sell their skills and be
their own best competitive advantage.
