The Emotional Revival, a roadmap to engage and activate our hearts in order to mobilize and lead the change we wish to see. The Emotional Revival offers tools, examples and practices to opening, connecting and living from our heart centers. It illustrates how our hearts have memory, our hearts have intelligence, and our heartâ€™s have the ability to be a compass for truth.

We were born purely emotional beings. Our needs and wants were experienced as feelings and expressed emotionally. Somewhere along the way in our evolution, we were taught to disengage from this. To let our analytical mind overpower our heart. Â And we developed a language of emotional assault – "man-up", "don't cry like a girl", "don't wear your emotions on your sleeve", "don't be so dramatic", "suck it up". We shamed feelings which led to emotional dismemberment.

The Emotional Revival is a live out loud and large remembering of how to feel, how to connect, how to create, how to communicate and how to be empowered in our own selves.
