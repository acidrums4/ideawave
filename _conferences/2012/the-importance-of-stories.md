Any information can be seen as a story, and all possible world views
are just stories, we are just characters in living stories unless you
don’t believe this story. Some stories are better then others, but
what judges a good story from a bad story and how should we deal with
stories that are harmful. In anthropology, people can be defined as being
bio-cultural. This means that our cultural being, which are made up of
stories, are just as important to us as our biological being. Some might
say that our cultural being surpasses the importance of our biological
being and the opposite could be true as well, but whatever the case
we hold both very dearly and our morals are based in protection of
both. What kind of story should we have is a very hard question because
the responses could be close to infinite it’s far easier to look at
what kind of stories we shouldn’t have. We shouldn’t have stories
that place themselves above others and see them selves as the only story
because this leads to conquering and conquering leads to monoculture
which is unsustainable.
