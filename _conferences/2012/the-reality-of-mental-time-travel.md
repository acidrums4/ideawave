Psychologists at Harvard University are using fMRI (Functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging) technology, to enable them to look into the brain as we are
thinking. They have concluded that the frontal lobe of our brain is a ‘time
machine’. The ability of mental time travel is not only the evolutionary
development which enabled our ancestors to thrive in their environment, the
regular practice of mental time travel is likely one of the major unrecognized
secrets of success. Long misunderstood and maligned as ‘daydreaming’ or
‘frivolous imagining’, mental time travel is the source of human creativity.
Its practice is not only the source of personal evolution, happiness and peace
of mind. It is also the key to solving the problems facing society in the
twenty-first century.
