Design thinking is a methodology used for investigating ill-defined problems,
acquiring information, analyzing knowledge, and positing solutions in the
design and planning fields. Centered around creativity, empathy, rationality,
and putting the user’s needs as the heart of the problem, design thinking is
seen as an important tool for driving innovation. But design Thinking is not
just for designers, it’s for engineers trying to solve a problem; it is for
parents who want to expand their children’s view of the world and teachers
looking for new ways to engage their students. It is a new way of looking at
things that is quickly becoming a core element in business strategy all around
the world. This presentation will outline the ways everyone can benefit from
the techniques and strategies of this innovative methodology.
