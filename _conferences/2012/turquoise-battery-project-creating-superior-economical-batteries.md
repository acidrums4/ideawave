In 2008 I decided to try creating a superior but economical battery chemistry.
The art of battery making didn’t seem to be very well explored. Especially,
salty electrolyte cells had had no real development since the standard dry
cell in the 1880s.

What’s in a battery? [show & explain parts]  
-case  
-electrode briquettes  
-current collectors & terminals  
-electrolyte

But all common metals including nickel corrode in salt anodes. Carbon rods and
graphite sheets gave poor results. So I invented ‘grafpoxy’, a conductive
mixture of epoxy and graphite to allow coated metal electrode screens and
connections. That opens up the whole salty battery field.

Chemicals and reactions also appeared to be almost unexplored for salty
electrolyte. I found a number of good substances and reactions.

Positive Electrodes

-Nickel hydroxides  
-Vanadium oxides  
-Manganese oxides  
-Rare earth perchlorate-chloride

Negative electrodes

-nickel  
-zinc  
-manganese – the new highest energy electrode

I’ll put instructions for making these batteries into a book on the web.

is one of Canada’s most experienced inventors, since 2008 tackling several
renewable energy, energy storage and electric transport projects concurrently.
