What if this was the year to ask the question what else is possible and let go
of all the conclusions and points of view that get in the way of receiving new
information? This talk provides the opportunity to explore new ways of asking
questions in order to access new insights and perspectives that we may never
have been aware of before. What if it were more fun to ask great questions
than seek out the ‘right’ answers? How much have we been rewarded for having
the right answer and shut down or made wrong for asking too many questions?
What else is possible? Join me in exploring how 2012 can be the year of living
in the possibility and seeing what shows up, without having to figure it all
out. How does it get any better than that?
