   **IdeaWave**

July 10 and 11, 2010

Vancouver Island

If you are a critical thinker interested in ideas, you have come to the right place.

IdeaWave is a two-day conference that is all about ideas. The goal of the conference is to engage critical thinkers and build on the energy that is created when ideas are shared, discussed and debated.

We have created a forum that is accessible to anyone who wants to hear ideas, share ideas and talk about ideas.

IdeaWave features 50 talks in two days on a broad range of ideas. Itâ€™s like a two-day conversation about ideas with other critical thinkers from far and wide.

Check back for details on speakers and post conference events. A full lineup of speakers will be posted closer to the conference date. See our conference page for more details.
