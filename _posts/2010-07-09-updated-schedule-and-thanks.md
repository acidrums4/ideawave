We’ve posted the [initial schedule with speakers]({% link _conferences/2010.md %}). It is to be used as a general idea, it will change within hours I’m sure as we’re accepting more talks etc.

Thanks for the overwhelming support we’re receiving today in way of talk submissions,Â communityÂ sponsorshipÂ and registrations! It was said that this could be the most mentally stimulating week-end Victoria has ever had. Here’s to hoping!
