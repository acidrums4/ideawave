Thanks to CHEK NEWS for the partnership, all of our sponsors and donors, our board of advisors/submission reviewers, our speakers and attendees, volunteers, Morgan Cranny (our MC), and all of the local media, for what some have said:

“This was the best conference I’ve ever been to”   “I was on the edge of my seat [with excitement] for the entire conference”   “Not enough words! Still buzzing.”   “It was enlightening, connecting, and energizing”

We couldn’t have asked for a better reception to our inaugural conference. Give us a couple days to breathe, as we have various follow-up announcements over the next couple weeks.

Signed,

—   Kris
