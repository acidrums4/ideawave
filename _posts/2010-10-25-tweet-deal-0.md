We think everyone has ideas, and we want to encourage the sharing of them.
Tweet your idea, any idea, in under 140 characters, including **@ideawave_ca**
in the tweet. At the end of day on November 1st weâ€™ll randomly pick two of the
idea submitters, and give each of them one ticket to [ our next conference,

which will be held in Victoria, BC on the last week-end of February, 2010. It
can be any idea, on any subject, we look forward to reading them!
