If you attended the conference last year, you’re with us in the building excitement that the conference is only two weeks away! We’ve got an amazing line up speakers already, and we have less than 100 tickets left for sale. In only our second year, we’re getting speakers and attendees from all over North America. As we’re only a couple weeks away, a few last minute notes:

* It’s not too late to submit a talk! The deadline for submitting talks is when 50 talks have been published. Submit a talk today, if it’s accepted you get full access to the conference.
* If you’re a student, use the scholarship submission form instead to be eligible for one of our $500 scholarships.
* We’re still looking for sponsors! Contact us for a list of our sponsorship packages. We have individual packages from $150 and organization packages from $300! A great way to get visibility in the community for supporting idea generation and innovation, as well as keep this conference going year after year.
* We’ve strategically made full conference tickets only $50, which makes us what we believe is the most affordable ideas conference in the world. There are less then 100 tickets left this year, so register today!
