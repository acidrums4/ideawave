Thanks to everyone for their submissions! Effective immediately, we’ve removed
the submissions and student submissions links as a result. It wasn’t easy
going through the submissions we got from all over North America this year,
but as a result we’ve got a stellar line up of ideas. Thanks again and we look
forward to seeing everyone next week-end!
