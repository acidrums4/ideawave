As there are people coming into Victoria from all over North America tomorrow, I figure I should offer somewhere for you all to go. Being the night before the conference, myself and the board will likely be busy doing last minute preparations, such as making badges, etc. If we finish up in a reasonable time, we’ll be sure to head down and join the group!   But that doesn’t mean you have to suffer! The folks over the the [Bard and Banker](http://www.bardandbanker.com/) have offered us a room tomorrow evening, starting at 8pm. This is open to all speakers and attendees! Step out of your shell, and really get to know the other critical thinking participants!
