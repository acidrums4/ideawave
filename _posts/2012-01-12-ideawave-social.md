Our good friends at [Temple Events and Catering ](http://templeevents.ca/)have taken it upon themselves to ensure we have an opportunity to continue dialog in a relaxed atmosphere by sponsoring the first ever IdeaWave social!

The social will be on the evening of Feb 25th, 2012 from 7-11pm. You will require your badge and photo ID to enter the facility, so donâ€™t forget either! Thanks to everyone at Temple for this generous sponsorship!
