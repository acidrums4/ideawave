Thanks to our good friends at [Temple Events and
Catering](https://web.archive.org/web/20211018015726/http://templeevents.ca/),
as well as [Lighthouse Brewing
Company](https://web.archive.org/web/20211018015726/http://www.lighthousebrewing.com/),
this year weâ€™ll host the first IdeaWave social. Join us on Saturday February
25th, 2012 from 6:00-9:30pm for a social mixer. You will require your IdeaWave
name badge to enter. Another chance to engage with other attendees and
speakers in a social environment!
