Thanks to our good friends at [Temple Events and Catering](http://templeevents.ca/), as well as [Lighthouse Brewing Company](http://www.lighthousebrewing.com/), this year weâ€™ll host the first IdeaWave social. Join us on Saturday February 25th, 2012 from 6:00-9:30pm for a social mixer. You will require your IdeaWave name badge to enter. Another chance to engage with other attendees and speakers in a social environment!
