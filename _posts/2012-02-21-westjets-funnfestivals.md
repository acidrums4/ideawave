Westjet is running a vote based campaign to determine the top festivals in Canada. Thanks to everyone who has voted, we’ve made it into the top 20! We’re currently listed as #1 in Victoria, #5 in British Columbia, and #18 in all of Canada!   You can see [our page on Westjet here](http://www.westjetfestivals.com/festival/2012/ideawave), and don’t forget to vote, daily! (You’re eligible to win a bunch of Westjet prizes if you vote!)
