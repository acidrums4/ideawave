Adam Kreek is a loving husband and proud father who lives part-time in two
cities: Victoria, BC, and Ottawa, ON.

An Olympic gold medalist in Beijing 2008, he is writing a book due out
this fall with a working title, Confessions of an Olympian. Adam explores
the secrets of great achievement through the lens of his Olympic journey,
in a sport that is often described as the most physically demanding,
and most reliant upon teamwork: rowing in an eight-man shell. Adam has
retired from international competition, but keeps close ties to the
Olympic movement. He sits on the Canadian Olympic Committee board of
directors and is the vice-chair of the athletes commission.

Although retired, Adam still rows. He regularly fishes for crabs in his
sliding-seat whitehall spirit dory. Also, in December of this year he will row
across the Atlantic ocean from Liberia to Venezuela, supporting Right to Play
and making another documentary.
