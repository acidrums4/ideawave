Alan Cassels has been immersed in pharmaceutical policy research for the
past 17 years, primarily working on national and provincial studies of
prescription benefit policies, and the effects of independent information on
prescriber and consumer behaviour. His interest in the quality of health
coverage has made him into one of Canada’s leading researchers on Canadian
medical reporting. He has frequently reported on consumer health issues for
magazines, newspapers and the CBC Radio program IDEAS. His book, Selling
Sickness: How the World’s Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies are Turning us All
into Patients (co-written with Ray Moynihan) was an international bestseller.

His second book, The ABC’s of Disease Mongering: An Epidemic in 26 letters, is
an illustrated book of rhymes which one critic likened to “Dr. Seuss taking on
an overmedicated and over-diagnosed culture.”
