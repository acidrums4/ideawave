Before launching CampbellDuke Personal Branding, Beth
worked for a decade in the biotech sector, where she spent a significant
amount of her volunteer time tutoring adult literacy, working with the
regional science fair, and coordinating volunteers for the 24-Hour Relay for
Easter Seals.

Perhaps not surprisingly, she left biotech to “retool” as a high school
teacher and spent another seven years teaching. During the last 2 years of her
formal teaching career, she and a colleague took on the challenge of the
redesign and implementation of a Career and Academic Readiness program for at-
risk youth, re-engaging them in their own education by focusing on their
strengths and showing them that they could be successful in school and life.
