> My name is Briana Vojnovich. I am a third-year undergraduate student at
the University of Victoria, in the Social Sciences Faculty. I am working
towards completing a major in Sociology and a minor in Business. While in
school, I work part-time at the Keg on Quadra St. and I am a member of the
University of Victoria chapter of Young Women in Business. I was a Miss
Nanaimo Ambassador from April 2007 to late-September, 2008, and because of
this I have had thorough practice in public speaking through the Toast Masters
program. I have a performance background as a dancer, singer, and actor, which
also contributes to my comfort in front of large audiences.
