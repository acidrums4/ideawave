> I’m sometimes a researcher. I’ve been studying worlds of our solar
system whenever data becomes available with special interest in the
moons --- and _planets_ bigger than Mercury --- that orbit Jupiter and
Saturn. I have followed Galileo, Huygens and Cassini missions with great
attention and have come to see what I feel is the ‘big picture’ of
the surface of Titan and several other worlds, avoiding errors of narrow
and uncorrelated interpretation of data that space scientists have fallen
victim to.
