David Bratzer wears many hats but he is perhaps best known for his work
as an advocate for criminal justice reform. He is a member of the board
of directors for Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP), which is
an international non-profit organization of current and former cops,
prosecutors and correctional officers who seek to minimize crime,
addiction, disease and death by gradually legalizing and regulating
drugs. David is also concerned about the impact of drug prohibition on
our education system, and in this respect he assists Canadian Students
for Sensible Drug Policy as a member of their advisory board.
