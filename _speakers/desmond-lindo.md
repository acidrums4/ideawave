Desmond Lindo shares many personal traits and characteristics with the
African Rhinoceros. Short-sighted and incredibly thick-skinned, he possesses a
cranium designed by nature for butting heads, which he loves to engage in with
other obtuse individuals.  

A former long-time resident of Victoria, his current roaming territory is the
intellectually-barren veldt of the Comox Valley. He charges down to Victoria
from time to time to feed on its lush intellectual greenery.
