> It is said that artists starve, so I chose computers instead. Since I began my
career in 1999, I’ve done everything from system administration to graphic
design to writing web apps and big-data business intelligence systems. There
are a few epithets that describe my body of expertise, but the nice one is
“self-directed learner”. I hung up my spurs as a security developer near the
end of 2007 to integrate what I had learned programming with what I am
learning in user experience design, business and management, and to set about
tackling what I believe are some serious problems addling the increasingly
important business of realizing software.
