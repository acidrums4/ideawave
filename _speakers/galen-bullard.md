My passion for understanding the world led me to earn a Bachelor of Science
degree at the University of Western Ontario, where I studied the computer
simulation of flocking behavior with a pioneer in the field. I consulted in
the computer industry for nine years in database design and system
simulations. Next, my work in filmmaking and study of cinema semiotics showed
me pathways to get inside the mind of the viewer in order to move them.

Meditation and other self-awareness disciplines gave me direct insight into
how the human mind works. I have drawn on all these experiences to explore
flocking behavior in humans and how it can be applied for positive effect. I
now work in Victoria as a freelance writer.
