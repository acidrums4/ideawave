> I was born on Vancouver Island in Coombs (yes where the goats are on the roof,
but across the road). Most of my life has been spent in Sooke where I
graduated from high school and raised a family. I commercially fished and
owned and operated my own forestry company which included sawing added value
products. In 2002 I retired and relocated to Victoria.  

> In 2002 I volunteered with VSO (Volunteer Service Overseas) for 13 months as a
Community Developer in Zambia. Since than I have been spending at least six
months of the year there working at village level, concentrating on
reforestation, environmental concerns, clean water and community schools. And
in Mozambique as a Community Developer for the Kapasseni Project from
Victoria.  

> 2004/07 my day job was a Consultant for the EU designing and building solar
powered dry kilns for the carvers and craft people of Zambia.  

> In 2008 I received the International Achievement Award from the Canadian
Institute of Forestry for my work in Zambia.  

> 2010 Still working on projects in Zambia and Mozambique. Will be going back in
March to start the year.
