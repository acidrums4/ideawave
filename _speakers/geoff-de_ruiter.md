> My name is Geoff de Ruiter. I am a recent graduate of UVic with a masters
degree in Kinesiology/Neuroscience. My undergraduate degree was obtained from
UNBC in Prince George in the field of Biology and Microbiology. While
attending UNBC I completed two undergraduate research theses: one examining
genetic variability in a species of carp from China, and the other proposing
various renewable energy systems to displace considered energy generation from
coal fired power plants in BC. In the winter of 2008 I won the BC Hydro
Innovation Challenge for proposing 21% energy saving techniques and
technologies at UNBC, specifically focusing on snow storage for summer
cooling.  

> Over the Past 5 years I have been actively involved in the environmental
movement focusing on renewable energy, but advocating for and becoming
knowledgeable in many fields of sustainability.  

> In my spare time I enjoy science, cycling, surfing, snorkeling in rivers,
lakes, and the ocean, hiking, camping, speed skating, adventuring, living in
BC, and generally awesome and interesting things.  

> One interesting factoid is that I have held my breath for exactly 3 minutes
and 30 seconds.  

> Finally, I love BC.
