Greg is the founder of One Hundred For Haiti and has been to Haiti seven
times since the earthquake. Immediately after the January 12th earthquake in
Haiti, Greg was on the crew of the Liberty Schooner, an all-volunteer mission
that sailed from Miami to the southern coast of Haiti to bring 10,000 pounds
of medical supplies and food to the people in most dire need. The Liberty and
its crew were the first independent relief boat to reach the southern coast of
Haiti from the United States and Greg received international press coverage of
the trip on the Peter Greenberg Worldwide radio program. He realized the need
for ongoing involvement and One Hundred For Haiti campaign responded to that
need, through ongoing support and development projects. Greg is also the co-
founder of The World Leaders Project, a multi-year initiative to discuss
issues related to the psychology of human violence face-to-face with world
leaders, an initiative that led to a meeting with the President of Guyana as
well as correspondence with other governments as well. He was the co-producer
of the multi-award winning documentaries “Flight From Death: The Quest for
Immortality” and “The Philosopher Kings”, two films which explore often unseen
sides of the human experience: our relationship with death and the effect that
this has on our psyche, and the quest for wisdom and with whom in our social
strata does that wisdom reside. He makes his living as a keynote speaker
worldwide.
