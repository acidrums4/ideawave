Isabella Mori is a counsellor and writer. Born in Germany, she grew up listening to endless conversations about art, philosophy and psychology. After living in the UK, Paraguay and Chile, she came to Canada in 1982. She has steeped herself in psychology, focusing on topics from chronic pain to transformative learning to eating disorders and brief therapy, and has a BA in psychology and philosophy and a Masters Degree in Distance Education, where she focused on the psychological aspects of adult learning. Isabella has led meditation groups, conducted research projects, and for some years, worked in the trenches of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. In her own words, "I am passionate about supporting people in making a better life for themselves and believe that everyone has the power and knowledge to create goodness for themselves and the world around them". Her blog, change therapy, is Canada's oldest and most populated blog written by a mental health professional. It discusses psychology, creativity, spirituality and social justice. She is the co-organizer of Mental Health Camp, a series of conferences on the intersection between mental health and social media.
