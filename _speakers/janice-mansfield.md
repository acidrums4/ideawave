Janice Mansfield is the personal chef behind Real Food Made Easy,
providing catering services and meal planning and preparation for
people with restricted diets, after working 18 years in government as
an economist. She also enjoys classic cocktails, and began incorporating
cocktails into catered dinners and special events.

In 2009, she began experimenting with bitters, in order to create products she
was unable to find in Canada, and found demand from others experiencing the
same frustration. Those first bitters experiments have evolved into “House
Made” bitters, a line of micro-batch, artisinal bitters, with a distinct
culinary edge. “House Made” now produces 8 standard flavours of bitters, with
a changing selection of one-time, seasonal flavours, and produces a line of
cocktail syrups.

Janice enjoys a well crafted cocktail from time to time, and while not
a full-blown barfly, is certainly working hard on being a bon vivant!
