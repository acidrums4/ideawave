Jean-Daniel Cusin has over 25 years of business management experience
working with organizations in virtually every sector of activity from mining
to pharmaceuticals, food preparation to software development, service
organizations and non-profits to heavy manufacturing. His areas of focus
includes operational improvement, business process and operational
optimization as well as structural and leadership alignment.

Today, he is specialized in effective organizational processes, structures and
governance. He recently launched a new venture called e-Deliberation that
supports organizations and groups with the deliberation and resolution of
“wicked” problems --- problems that are multi-dimensional and that impact a lot
of stakeholders. Mr. Cusin feels that most the problems we face as a society
are “wicked” in that they are apparently intractable, complex and impact a lot
of people. Hence his interest, and motivation to do something about it.

Mr. Cusin was born in Switzerland, is a Canadian citizen and lives on the
Island. He obtained his M.A. in Leadership and Training from Royal Roads
University.
