Joshua Caldwell, born February 6, 1978 in Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii.

> The first computer I used was a Commodore PET with 8 or 4k of memory.

> I learned very little from Computer Science 12, which I took in Grade 10, as
did many people in that class. We pursued our own projects. I got involved
with BBS stuff and in 1995 had a Linux BBS set up (there was only one other
Linux BBS in the lower mainland, not counting ISPs.)

> I took a lot of English, literature, and creative writing courses, as well as
many history courses.

> I ran a small ISP business with two of my friends for a while.

> When I got to university, I had fun the first year, but hit the “sophomore
slump” and lost direction.

> In 2009 I decided the leave the educational system, considering how many
victims the whole system produced. During have my career as a student, I never
stopped reading blogs. In fact, I was reading blogs before they were even
called that.

> So far, I have had some commercial success providing high level support,
systems analysis, and some programming. I started training again about 3 weeks
ago after a 3 month bout with pneumonia. Aside from basic conditioning, I’ll
most likely be taking karate again.

> I have a lot of crazy ideas that with a little money or time could be very
interesting. We’ll see what 2012 brings.
