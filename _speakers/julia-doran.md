I love adventure and jump at any opportunity to travel. I love the
outdoors, motorcycles and reading. I have a passion for languages
and enjoy learning about different cultures. I think it is fair to
say I like taking the road less travelled and doing things just a bit
differently than most. I have a professional background in marketing,
sales and event planning which has been fostered through my positions
Warner Music and Whistler Blackcomb. I have a Political Science degree
from Lakehead University and I am currently an MBA student at the Peter
B. Gustavson School of Business.
