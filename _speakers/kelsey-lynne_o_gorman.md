> My name is Kelsey Lynne O’Gorman, and I am a 4th year student currently
studying at Vancouver Island University. I am graduating this year with my
Bachelor’s of Science, majoring in molecular biology with a minor in
analytical chemistry. I love to travel to different parts of the world and
volunteer whilst visiting and submerge myself in the local culture. I have
worked in a hospital in South East Asia, learnt about Tropical Ecology and
Biology in Belize, and recently went to Kenya to volunteer for three weeks at
a Primary School. My future goals are to become a doctor and go to third world
countries to provide medical care and experience and learn from the local
cultures that I am surrounded by.

> I also love to cook and bake a variety of food, and love spending time with my
family and friends. I am very much an outdoors person and love reducing my
carbon footprint by minimizing my energy consumption, riding my bike, using
earth friendly chemicals, and supporting local organic produce. I also
volunteer at various local organizations such as the Canadian Cancer Society,
Raise a Reader, Youth Volunteer Corporation, and most recently St. John’s
Ambulance.
