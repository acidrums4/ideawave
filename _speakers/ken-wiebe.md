over the past thirty years.

> Have held the positions of Party Leader, Director, and sat on numerous
Committees. I know the political party system and how it actually works (or
does not work), and why it inevitably leads to the type of politics (and
politicians) we all love to hate.

> Currently working as an Information Systems Consultant. Hands-on designing,
refining, analyzing and correcting complex digital information systems in
small to medium size organizations.
