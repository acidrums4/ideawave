> My name is Kevin Koch, I am currently a undergrad at the University
of Victoria. I am a coach for Victoria High Schoolâ€™s improv team
and over the summer I was a camp counsellor at camp Thunder Bird. I am
a vegetarian and an atheist but in noways am I against eating meat or
religion (except for maybe a few aspects of a particular few). tories to
me are one of the most significant parts of our lives, and our cultural
being should be treated just as well as our physical ones.
