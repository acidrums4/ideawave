> I have worked as a psychiatrist for the past 26 years and
am a Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver. My clinical practice incorporates the principles
derived from this approach to the understanding of self-esteem and the things
that can and do go awry with it.
