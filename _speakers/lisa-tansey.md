Lisa Tansey --- Born in Palo Alto, California --- so started out seeing the US
as the center of the world. Then attended college in Canada, so got a broader
view of the world. Got a degree in biology & geography --- love maps, love
electron microscope pictures! Have done many jobs --- from cashier and waitress
to recombinant DNA jockey and Oracle DBA. Love DNA, love data!  

Started wondering about this question while working in Washington D.C. & saw
the actual EPA buildings; realized the government employees there had almost
no chance of knowing what theyâ€™d need to do regarding my San Diego
neighborhood!
