Lliam Hildebrand came to the environmental movement through working in the
steel industry. While working on a wind farm project, he was inspired to rent
“An Inconvenient Truth”. After watching this movie by Al Gore he was
immediatley motivated to find out how he could help in the collaborative
effort to stop global warming. However, when researching how to get involved,
he found the movement in Victoria was very dispersed and hard to tap into. It
was even harder to find a perfect match between himself and an organization
that could use his particular skills for a sustainability initiative. This
circumstance is what motivated the creation of Integreen, so that people of
all skill sets and backgrounds can find their place in the movement and start
making a positive difference in the world.
