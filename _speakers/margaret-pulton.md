> I was born in Rossland B.C. and I grew up in Edmonton Alberta and graduated
from the University of Alberta school of nursing. Our graduating class will be
celebrating our 50th anniversary this year. My husband and I met in highschool
and married in 1961. We had three daughters and moved to Victoria in 1972. My
husband was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in his twenties. The disease was
slow but progressive so we were constantly adapting our lives to cope with the
disease. In the early 90â€™s, we bought an IBM 386 computer along with an
amazing voice recognition program. Bill, my husband, was actually able to
dictate correspondence on the machine although it was very primitive, but I
realized then the incredible potential of technology to change and improve the
lives of people facing huge challenges. I am amazed and delighted with what
has been accomplished so far and am excited about what is yet to come.
