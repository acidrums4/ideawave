Martin Barnett was educated in England and came to Canada in 1977.
Together with his family he ran bakeries in Victoria and Vancouver and more
recently was with The Fairmont Empress Hotel. He has been instructing the
professional baking and pastry programs at VIU since 2000. Martin just
returned from a 3 month tour of Artisan Bakeries in Australia and is excited
about the future, creative possibilities surrounding the new Wood Fired Brick
Oven at VIU.

“Our trade is continually redefining itself and marrying the classic products
and their traditional skill sets with modern approaches and techniques. The
resurgence of craft baking and all that it entails is very exciting!”
