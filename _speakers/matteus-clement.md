> I am the external executive for the Camosun College student society
(CCSS) and have been for the last year and a half. I will be graduating
from the applied communications program in May. In my roll at the CCSS
I have lobbied government for more accessible education through lower
tuition, eliminating interest on student loans and bringing back the
grants program that was eliminated in 2004. I truly believe that most
problems can be solved through a collective consultation process that
results in an outcome that is both socially beneficial as well as
economically sound.
