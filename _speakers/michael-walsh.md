Michael Walsh is the Executive Director of LifeRing Canada, a peer-support
addiction recovery group based on three principles: sobriety, secularity, and
self-help. Through Michael’s own recovery of 9+ years, it was important to
repair relationships along the way --- a process of which he is still engaged.
Michael states, “There is a lot of shame and guilt around addiction, and
confronting those I have harmed has not been easy. It took me five years to
contact my sister.” Had something like a restorative circle been in place,
Michael would have acted sooner. Michael believes that repairing relationships
and rebuilding trust is an integral part of recovery. He hopes to some day
provide restorative processes to assist others.
