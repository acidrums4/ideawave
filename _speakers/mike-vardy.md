he is also editor) and Life As A Human. He has several years of stage
experience and has created works for CBC Radio and the print media as well.

Mike Vardy is the writer, speaker, and “productivityist” behind Vardy.me
and the productivity parody site Eventualism. Vardy’s candid satire has made
him a desirable speaker on an often dry topic, delivering talks on the topic
such as “Hacking Lifehacks” at TEDx Juan De Fuca and presenting keynote talks
at events in Vancouver and Victoria. Currently a Managing Editor at Stepcase
Lifehack, Vardy has contributed to many popular productivity websites and
publications, including David Allen’s GTD Times and Productive Magazine and
has appeared in local publications (YAM Magazine, Black Press) and nationally
in The Globe and Mail. He lives with his wife, daughter and son in Victoria,
BC, Canada.

He has an amazing wife and two equally amazing children.
