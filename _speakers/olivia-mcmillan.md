I am a biology undergraduate student at the University of Victoria with hopes to pursue a career in marine ecology and environmental conservation. Ever since I can remember, sharks have been my passion. As a young child I explored countless books on this mysterious fish in amazement, wondering how such a powerful and graceful creature could be so blatantly misunderstood. Having grown up on Vancouver Island, I have been raised with a love of the ocean that has become a devotion to its preservation. I have plans to positively change the way the public currently views sharks and help to revive this beautiful creatureâ€™s diminishing populations. The judgements that have been passed based purely on cases of mistaken identity and what has been seen in the movies have reached their breaking point. I believe the best way to create a better situation is through education of the consequences of our current actions and suggestions as to what can be done to prevent such costly mistakes in the years to come.
