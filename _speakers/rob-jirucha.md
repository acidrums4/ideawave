Rob Jirucha holds an MA in Counseling Psychology.

> I spent 15 years working with youth in counseling and outdoor-based
settings. I am a self- taught photographer and began Legacy by Photography
this past year. L by P is an effort to photograph seniors and elders in
the settings and situations that define their character.

> My photo-documentary work with aboriginal elders often captures elders and
their efforts to pass on values and culture to youth. Given my past work with
youth, I have some interesting observations to share about North American
youth and Aboriginal youth.

> A short video I put together of one local elder can be viewed at [http://vimeo.com/36110389](https://vimeo.com/36110389).
