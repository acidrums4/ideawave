> I am in my first year in Camosun Collegeâ€™s Applied Communication Program,
where I am improving my skills in video, radio, desktop and web publishing,
journalistic writing, and photography. Last year I spent 6 months in
Australia, where I fell madly in love with Melbourne. This summer I am headed
to Montreal to be a digital marketing intern at the Just for Laughs comedy
festival, an internship that I got without sending a cover letter or resume!
