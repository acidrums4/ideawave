I am a Critical Studies major at Emily Carr University, who is currently a
professional chess player in a game called life. I am interested in Global art
and the idea of art in the contemporary that stands against all the critical
ideas and theories and has the ability to be aesthetic and beautiful while
still allow for meaning and information.
