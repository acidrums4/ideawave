Iâ€™m a founding partner of Blue Gecko. I manage and am a senior administrator
in the Open Databases / LAMP practice. We do remote administration and
management of databases around the world.

I additionally run the Seattle meetups for LinuxChix, MySQL, and one focused
on Opensource and general geeky socializing.
