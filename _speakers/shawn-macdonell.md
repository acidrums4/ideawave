> For years I followed the pattern. I was going to be a computer engineer, work at Nortel, and then eventually take over the world. That didnâ€™t happen for me so I searched for a better way. A way that would give me passion and not just things that I was good at. I could not find help-counsellors gave me tests that told me I should be an engineer. I found my own way I began life mapping. The life map told me many things-1. Computers were only a highlight in my life once, 2. I love being outdoors, 3. I love working with people, 4. I love teaching, 5. I love sports. So I built my whole life around putting those things together and working with them.

> I have been an athletics coach for over a decade now coaching at every level from community to provincial to unviersity in rugby, hockey, and volleyball.

> I run a company called Creativision where everyday I get to work with my passions. I have created new patterns of working and thinking for myself and everyday is filled with exciting challenges.

> I am a passionate, energetic, creative thinker who is looking to make a difference.
