> I am a writer, educator and artist currently living in Victoria, British
Columbia. For the past three years, much of my work has centered around
political theory and political ecology, as I’ve both worked and studied soil
as an amateur gardener and an MA student at Acadia University in the Annapolis
Valley, Nova Scotia.

> I am inspired by organizations like the Galileo Society, a 19th century
Hungarian student association, whose members sought to educate those who, for
whatever reason, could not attend university. This organizational model has
been repeated (Paulo Freire’s work, the Workers Education Movement, etc.)
because it is worth repeating. Teaching, and the sharing of ideas and skills
with others, regardless of one’s level of expertise, has always been a passion
for me and given the present state of the world I think we all have a lot to
learn from one another.

> In partnership with me on this project is Heather Cosidetto, an artist,
writer, educator, and program facilitator with a talent for drawing people
together to accomplish a little more than they thought they could. Our long
term goal with this project is to secure a permanent facility in a semi-rural
location which can play host to any number of creative and educational
projects. Our inaugural season of programming is to be an important first step
in making that larger vision possible.
