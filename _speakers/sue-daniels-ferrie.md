Sue Daniels-Ferrie, although not having died yet herself, has been
present for the passing of many friends, colleagues and family members. She
has been responsible for ensuring the last wishes of the deceased were carried
out, as well as conducting funeral services and eulogies for over 20 years.

Sue is a certified funeral celebrant, a 5th generation native Victorian, born
and raised here, wife, mother of 4, nana to 6, and animal lover. Sue knows
that death is inevitable and plans on making it easy as possible for those who
will be left behind, when someone we love dies.
