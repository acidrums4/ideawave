> Last year, I had the goal to become Student Council President
for my school. I had to prepare a speech that would captivate my
audience. Stumbling over my first few words made me nervous, but then,
I was on a roll. I achieved my goal and now I am heavily involved with
my schoolâ€™s leadership program. I enjoy learning the history of the
past as well as the new ideas of the future. I am a creative and liberal
person and I plan to attend Camosun College next year for the Visual Arts
program. My hobbies include travelling, photography, reading, sewing,
and scrapbooking (anything your Grandmother would do). In school, I
play on the field hockey and soccer teams, and outside of school I enjoy
more soccer and swimming (only in the right condition). In the summer,
I worked for an ESL camp and met kids from all over the world. I loved
hearing about the places they were from in their broken English. They
really gave me a global perspective and taught me that even though we
are thousands of miles apart, we are very much the same.
