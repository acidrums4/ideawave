Vanessa Pattison immigrated to Victoria from the UK in January 2010 with
a background in renewable energy, marketing and media. Sheâ€™s spent the last
year as chief labourer/GC as she fully renovates her 1925 house, which led her
to investigate ways to distract herself (escape the house occasionally!) as
well as elaborate on her new found skills and rejuvenate her creative side.

After discovering and attending Ideas Victoria, Vanessa heard about
Makerspace, took their metal forging class and got hooked into the makers/DIY
community, pitching for funds and helping organise events such as the
Vancouver Island Mini Maker Faire.
