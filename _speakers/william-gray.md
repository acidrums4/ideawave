> My wife and I have been innovators in education and corporate settings for
over 30 years. At the University of British Columbia, we discovered how to
enable future teachers (as mentors) to identify and respond to individual
differences in learners by carrying out a Mentor-Assisted Enrichment Project
with 2-5 proteges in grades 4-12. Via R&D, we discovered how to properly
structure MAEPs for gifted/talented, ESL and at-risk youth to produce
appropriate outcomes (higher-level thinking, better language facility,
motivation to stay in school). The mentors reported that they learned more
about working with individuals than they did in any other way during their
B.Ed Program. When we started our company, we combined the educational
paradigm (emphasizes methods and process) with the corporate paradigm
(emphasizes results), to create over 200 distinctive programs for corporate
and government clients. Each program was collaboratively planned to meet
different business goals and the needs/goals of individual participants. We
created paper products to enhance success, and later converted these into a
web-based system that manages the entire process (registration and matching
participants to work together in different ways, online training, monitoring
activity, evaluating results). [Our website](http://www.mentoring-solutions.com/)
lists “Firsts” we pioneered and continue to do.
