# About Us

IdeaWave is an annual conference held in beautiful Victoria, British
Columbia, on Vancouver Island. Our diverse membership is drawn from
[Ideas discussion groups](http://www.ideasmeetings.org) that happen in
cities around the world. If you’re a critical thinker and have an active
mind, this is the place for you. Join us and other like-minded individuals
in a venue designed to allow critical thinkers in the community to come
together to share ideas and build relationships.

Our mission is to **engage critical thinkers** in
 the community with the **goal of fostering innovation**.

This week-end long event, which started to sell out in its second year,
consists of 50 talks over 2 days. Each talk is ten minutes long and is
meant to act as a staging ground for longer discussions. There are no
restrictions on your topic as long as it’s based on an original idea
and is engaging for the audience.
